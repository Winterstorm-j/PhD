	abstract = {Bayesian networks have gained popularity as a probabilistic tool for reasoning with legal evidence. However, two common difficulties are (1) the construction and (2) the understanding of a network. In previous work, we proposed to use narrative tools and in particular scenario schemes to assist the construction and the understanding of Bayesian networks for legal cases. We proposed a construction method and a reporting format for explaining or understanding the network. The quality of a scenario, which plays an important role in the narrative approach to evidential reasoning, was not yet included in this method. In this paper, we provide a discussion of what constitutes the quality of a scenario, in terms of the narrative concepts of completeness, consistency and plausibility. We propose a probabilistic interpretation of these concepts, and show how they can be incorporated in our previously proposed method. We also illustrate with an example how these concepts concerning scenario quality can be used to explain or understand a Bayesian network.},

	abstract = {Background: Household settings are high risk for COVID-19 transmission. Understanding transmission factors associated with environmental dwelling characteristics is important in informing public health and building design recommendations. We aimed to develop a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to inform a novel analytical study examining the effect of dwelling environmental characteristics on household transmission of COVID-19. Methods: Key demographic, behavioural and environmental dwelling characteristics were identified by a multidisciplinary team. Using the DAG to visually display risk factors, and using expert knowledge of available datasets we reached a consensus on the factors included and directionality of relationships to build the final conceptual framework. Factors were displayed as nodes and relationships as pathways. Results: Of 34 potential factors, 16 were included in the DAG, with 13 causal and three biasing pathways. Three variables were not measurable using retrospective datasets. The DAG enabled us to select data sources for the pilot study period and to inform the analysis plan. Key exposure nodes were energy efficiency or dwelling age; dwelling type or number of storeys; and dwelling size. We determined direct and proxy confounders which we could adjust for, potential interactions terms we could test in model building, and co-linear variables to omit in the same model. Conclusions: The DAG helped identify key variables and datasets. It prioritised key nodes and pathways to formalise complex relationships between variables. It was pivotal in identifying unobserved variables, confounders, co-linearity and potential interactions. It has supported data selection and design of a retrospective pilot study analysis plan.},

	abstract = {Adaptive management is an iterative process of gathering new knowledge regarding a system's behavior and monitoring the ecological consequences of management actions to improve management decisions. Although the concept originated in the 1970s, it is rarely actively incorporated into ecological restoration. Bayesian networks (BNs) are emerging as efficient ecological decision-support tools well suited to adaptive management, but examples of their application in this capacity are few. We developed a BN within an adaptive-management framework that focuses on managing the effects of feral grazing and prescribed burning regimes on avian diversity within woodlands of subtropical eastern Australia. We constructed the BN with baseline data to predict bird abundance as a function of habitat structure, grazing pressure, and prescribed burning. Results of sensitivity analyses suggested that grazing pressure increased the abundance of aggressive honeyeaters, which in turn had a strong negative effect on small passerines. Management interventions to reduce pressure of feral grazing and prescribed burning were then conducted, after which we collected a second set of field data to test the response of small passerines to these measures. We used these data, which incorporated ecological changes that may have resulted from the management interventions, to validate and update the BN. The network predictions of small passerine abundance under the new habitat and management conditions were very accurate. The updated BN concluded the first iteration of adaptive management and will be used in planning the next round of management interventions. The unique belief-updating feature of BNs provides land managers with the flexibility to predict outcomes and evaluate the effectiveness of management interventions.},

BNs also have a modular architecture that facilitates iterative model development. For a model to be of value in generating and sharing knowledge or providing decision support, it must be built using good modelling practice. This paper provides guidelines to developing and evaluating Bayesian network models of environmental systems, and presents a case study habitat suitability model for juvenile Astacopsis gouldi, the giant freshwater crayfish of Tasmania. The guidelines entail clearly defining the model objectives and scope, and using a conceptual model of the system to form the structure of the BN, which should be parsimonious yet capture all key components and processes. After the states and conditional probabilities of all variables are defined, the BN should be assessed by a suite of quantitative and qualitative forms of model evaluation. All the assumptions, uncertainties, descriptions and reasoning for each node and linkage, data and information sources, and evaluation results must be clearly documented. Following these standards will enable the modelling process and the model itself to be transparent, credible and robust, within its given limitations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Almost 30 years ago, Bayesian networks (BNs) were developed in the field of artificial intelligence as a framework that should assist researchers and practitioners in applying the theory of probability to inference problems of more substantive size and, thus, to more realistic and practical problems. Since the late 1980s, Bayesian networks have also attracted researchers in forensic science and this tendency has considerably intensified throughout the last decade. This review article provides an overview of the scientific literature that describes research on Bayesian networks as a tool that can be used to study, develop and implement probabilistic procedures for evaluating the probative value of particular items of scientific evidence in forensic science. Primary attention is drawn here to evaluative issues that pertain to forensic DNA profiling evidence because this is one of the main categories of evidence whose assessment has been studied through Bayesian networks. The scope of topics is large and includes almost any aspect that relates to forensic DNA profiling. Typical examples are inference of source (or, 'criminal identification'), relatedness testing, database searching and special trace evidence evaluation (such as mixed DNA stains or stains with low quantities of DNA). The perspective of the review presented here is not exclusively restricted to DNA evidence, but also includes relevant references and discussion on both, the concept of Bayesian networks as well as its general usage in legal sciences as one among several different graphical approaches to evidence evaluation. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This paper proposes a practical methodology for combining evidence from different disciplines within the likelihood ratio framework. Evidence schemes introduced in this paper make the process of combining evidence more insightful and intuitive thereby assisting experts in their interdisciplinairy evaluation and in explaining this process to the courts. When confronted with two opposing scenarios and multiple types of evidence, the likelihood ratio approach allows experts to combine this evidence in a probabilistic manner. Parts of the prosecution and defence scenarios for which forensic science is expected to be informative are identified. For these so called core elements, activity level propositions are formulated. Afterwards evidence schemes are introduced to assist the expert in combining the evidence in a logical manner. Two types of evidence relations are identified: serial and parallel evidence. Practical guidelines are given on how to deal with both types of evidence relations when combining the evidence.},

That is, how evidence that is obtained in one case can be used in another and vice versa.

Like all probabilities, those that underlie the nodes within a network rely on structured data and knowledge. Obviously, the more structured data we have, the better. But, in real life, the numbers of experiments that can be carried out are limited. It is thus important to know if/when our knowledge is sufficient and when one needs to perform further experiments to be in a position to report the value of the observations made. To explore the impact of the amount of data that are available for assessing results, we have constructed Bayesian Networks and explored the sensitivity of the likelihood ratios to changes to the data that underlie each node. Bayesian networks are constructed and sensitivity analyses performed using freely available R libraries (gRain and BNlearn). We demonstrate how the analyses can be used to yield information about the robustness provided by the data used to inform the conditional probability table, and also how they can be used to direct further research for maximum effect. By maximum effect, we mean to contribute with the least investment to an increased robustness. In addition, the paper investigates the consequences of the sensitivity analysis to the discussion on how the evidence shall be reported for a given state of knowledge in terms of underpinning data.},

	abstract = {In court, it is typical for biological evidence to be reported at a level that only addresses how likely the DNA evidence is if it originated from a particular individual, or individuals. However, there are other questions that could be considered that would be of value in enabling the court, including the jury, to make better informed decisions. For example, although answers to specific questions such as: “Which type of bodily fluid has the DNA originated from?” or, “How was the DNA deposited at the scene?” would be probabilistic in nature, they can be crucial to the outcome of a case. The relationship between the DNA evidence, the source of the DNA and the activity that took place is described in a term called the “hierarchy of propositions.” Currently, such questions are usually answered by scientists subjectively with little to no logical framework to assist them. Bayesian networks have proven to be beneficial in providing logical reasoning by way of a likelihood ratio to help combine subjective, yet, experience‐based, opinions of experts with experimental data when answering questions which can be both complex and uncertain. These networks offer a framework that provides balance, transparency, and robustness in the evaluation of evidence. A current limitation of the use of Bayesian networks includes a lack of understanding of the underlying concepts from both forensic scientists and the courts and consequently a reduced recognition of the potential strengths.

However, normally their application is determined by the discretization of the continuous variables. In this paper the naïve Bayes (NB) and tree augmented naïve Bayes (TAN) models are developed. They are based on Mixtures of Truncated Exponentials (MTE) designed to deal with discrete and continuous variables in the same network simultaneously without any restriction. The aim is to characterize the habitat of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca graeca), using several continuous environmental variables, and one discrete (binary) variable representing the presence or absence of the tortoise. These models are compared with the full discrete models and the results show a better classification rate for the continuous one. Therefore, the application of continuous models instead of discrete ones avoids loss of statistical information due to the discretization. Moreover, the results of the TAN continuous model show a more spatially accurate distribution of the tortoise. The species is located in the Doñana Natural Park, and in semiarid habitats. The proposed continuous models based on MTEs are valid for the study of species predictive distribution modelling. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, when faced with a large complex domain, the task of modeling using Bayesian networks begins to resemble the task of pro­ gramming using logical circuits.

We use a Bayesian net­ work fragment to describe the probabilistic relations be­ tween the attributes of an object. These attributes can themsel ves be objects, providing a natural framework for encoding part-of hierarchies. Classes are used to pro­ vide a reusable probabilistic model which can be applied to multiple similar objects. Classes also support inher­ itance of model fragments from a class to a subclass, allowing the common aspects of related classes to be defined only once. Our language has clear declarative semantics: an OOBN can be interpreted as a stochas­ tic functional program, so that it uniquely specifies a probabilistic model. We provide an inference algorithm for OOBNs, and show that much of the structural infor­ mation encoded by an OOBN-particularly the encap­ sulation of variables within an object and the reuse of model fragments in different contexts-can also be used to speed up the inference process.},

	abstract = {Causal probabilistic networks have proved to be a useful knowledge representation tool for modelling domains where causal relations in a broad sense are a natural way of relating domain objects and where uncertainty is inherited in these relations. This paper outlines an implementation the HUGIN shell-for handling a domain model expressed by a causal probabilistic network. The only topological restriction imposed on the network is that, it must not contain any directed loops. The approach is illustrated step by step by solving a. genetic breeding problem. A graph representation of the domain model is interactively created by using instances of the basic network components-nodes and arcs-as building blocks. This structure, together with the quantitative relations between nodes and their immediate causes expressed as conditional probabilities, are automatically transformed into a tree structure, a junction tree. Here a computationally efficient and conceptually simple algebra of Bayesian belief universes supports incorporation of new evidence, propagation of information , and calculation of revised beliefs in the states of the nodes in the network. Finally, as an exam ple of a real world application, MUN1N an expert system for electromyography is discussed.},

	abstract = {Retriever Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become pivotal in enhancing the capabilities of language models by incorporating external knowledge retrieval mechanisms. However, a significant challenge in deploying these systems in industry applications is the detection and mitigation of hallucinations: instances where the model generates information that is not grounded in the retrieved context. Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of responses generated by large language models (LLMs) in diverse industry settings. Current hallucination detection techniques fail to deliver accuracy, low latency, and low cost simultaneously. We introduce Luna: a DeBERTA-large (440M) encoder, finetuned for hallucination detection in RAG settings. We demonstrate that Luna outperforms GPT-3.5 and commercial evaluation frameworks on the hallucination detection task, with 97\% and 91\% reduction in cost and latency, respectively. Luna is lightweight and generalizes across multiple industry verticals and out-of-domain data, making it an ideal candidate for industry LLM applications.},

In order to assign the probability of obtaining DNA findings, given competing propositions that specify transfer mechanisms, consideration must be given to a number of factors. Previous work by the authors developed a simple Object-Oriented Bayesian Network (OOBN) that pooled numerous published studies in order to attempt evaluation of trace DNA results given such propositions. In this work, we expand on the previously published OOBN and formalise a number of class networks that can be used together in a logical way to consider DNA movement through complex chains of transfer events. Specifically, we develop an OOBN that considers the two-way transfer of DNA that occurs when two items contact, and allows for the sampling of intermediary items involved in the chain of transfers. The aim is to show that adopting an approach involving basic building blocks, we offer the possibility to tackle complex and various cases for which the OOBN will be obtained by combining their elementary blocks. We conclude with a demonstration of applying the OOBN being applied to a chain of transfers in a case scenario.},

Humans have an innate ability to understand context, nuances, and subtle cues in communication, which allows us to comprehend jokes, sarcasm, and metaphors. Machines struggle to interpret such contextual information accurately. Humans possess a vast repository of common-sense knowledge that helps us make logical inferences and predictions about the world. Machines lack this innate understanding and often struggle with making sense of situations that humans find trivial. In this article, we review the prospective Machine Intelligence candidates, a review from Prof. Yann LeCun, and other work that can help close this gap between human and machine intelligence. Specifically, we talk about what's lacking with the current AI techniques such as supervised learning, reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning, etc. Then we show how Hierarchical planning-based approaches can help us close that gap and deep-dive into energy-based, latent-variable methods and Joint embedding predictive architecture methods.},

Steps that can be taken to share and use these data for research and casework purposes are outlined, and the prospects for future sharing of data through publicly accessible databases are discussed. This paper also explores potential avenues to proceed with implementation and is intended to fuel the discussion on sharing data pertaining to DNA TPPR issues.

	abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

	abstract = {Questions relating to how DNA from an individual got to where it was recovered from and the activities associated with its pickup, retention and deposition are increasingly relevant to criminal investigations and judicial considerations. To address activity level propositions, investigators are typically required to assess the likelihood that DNA was transferred indirectly and not deposited through direct contact with an item or surface. By constructing a series of Bayesian networks, we demonstrate their use in assessing activity level propositions derived from a recent legal case involving the alleged secondary transfer of DNA to a surface following a handshaking event. In the absence of data required to perform the assessment, a set of handshaking simulations were performed to obtain probabilities on the persistence of non-self DNA on the hands following a 40 min, 5 h or 8 h delay between the handshake and contact with the final surface (an axe handle). Variables such as time elapsed, and the activities performed and objects contacted between the handshake and contact with the axe handle, were also considered when assessing the DNA results. DNA from a known contributor was transferred to the right hand of an opposing hand-shaker (as a depositor), and could be subsequently transferred to, and detected on, a surface contacted by the depositor 40 min to 5 h post-handshake. No non-self DNA from the known contributor was detected in deposits made 8 h post-handshake. DNA from the depositor was generally detected as the major or only contributor in the profiles generated. Contributions from the known contributor were minor, decreasing in presence and in the strength of support for inclusion as the time between the handshake and transfer event increased. The construction of a series of Bayesian networks based on the case circumstances provided empirical estimations of the likelihood of direct or indirect deposition. The analyses and conclusions presented demonstrate both the complexity of activity level assessments concerning DNA evidence, and the power of Bayesian networks to visualise and explore the issues of interest for a given case.},

The latter however will frequently entail expressing a subjective probability i.e. simply making a best guess from experience. There is, to the present date, an extensive and complex body of literature on primary, secondary, tertiary and even higher order DNA transfer, its possibility, plausibility, dependency on an array of variables and factors and vast numbers of permutations thereof. However, from our point of view there is a lack of systematic data on DNA transfer with existing research widely varying in quality and relevance. Our aim was, starting from a comprehensive survey of the status quo and appreciating its increasing importance, to in the first part of our review raise consciousness towards the underestimated and insufficiently accounted for complexity of DNA transfer and thus appendant research of forensic scientists serving as expert witnesses in court but also acting in the role of a journal referee to point them to areas of criticism when reviewing a manuscript on DNA transfer. In the second part, we present propositions how to systematize and integrate future research efforts concerning DNA transfer. Also, we present a searchable database providing an extensive overview of the current state of knowledge on DNA transfer, intended to facilitate the identification of relevant studies adding knowledge to a specific question and thus help forensic experts to base their opinion on a broader, more complete and more reproducible selection of studies.},

	abstract = {Technical developments have made it possible to analyze very low amounts of DNA. This has many advantages, but the drawback of this technological progress is that interpretation of the results becomes increasingly complex: the number of mixed DNA profiles increased relatively to single source DNA profiles and stochastic effects in the DNA profile, such as drop-in and drop-out, are more frequently observed. Moreover, the relevance of low template DNA material regarding the activities alleged is not as straightforward as it was a few years ago, when for example large quantities of blood were recovered. The possibility of secondary and tertiary transfer is now becoming an issue. The purpose of this research is twofold: first, to study the transfer of DNA from the handler and secondly, to observe if handlers would transfer DNA from persons closely connected to them. We chose to mimic cases where the offender would attack a person with a knife. As a first approach, we envisaged that the defense would not give an alternative explanation for the origin of the DNA. In our transfer experiments (4 donors, 16 experiments each, 64 traces), 3\% of the traces were single DNA profiles. Most of the time, the DNA profile of the person handling the knife was present as the major profile: in 83\% of the traces the major contributor profile corresponded to the stabber's DNA profile (in single stains and mixtures). Mixture with no clear major/minor fraction (12\%) were observed. 5\% of the traces were considered of insufficient quality (more than 3 contributors, presence of a few minor peaks). In that case, we considered that the stabber's DNA was absent. In our experiments, no traces allowed excluding the stabber, however it must be noted that precautions were taken to minimize background DNA as knives were cleaned before the experiments. DNA profiles of the stabber's colleagues were not observed. We hope that this study will allow for a better understanding of the transfer mechanism and of how to assess and describe results given activity level propositions. In this preliminary research, we have focused on the transfer of DNA on the hand of the person. Besides, more research is needed to assign the probability of the results given an alternative activity proposed by the defense, for instance when the source of the DNA is not contested, but that the activities are.},

	abstract = {Bayesian logistic regression is used to model the probability of DNA recovery following direct and secondary transfer and persistence over a 24 h period between deposition and sample collection. Sub-source level likelihood ratios provided the raw data for activity-level analysis. Probabilities of secondary transfer are typically low, and there are challenges with small data-sets with low numbers of positive observations. However, the persistence of DNA over time can be modelled by a single logistic regression for both direct and secondary transfer, except that the time since deposition must be compensated by an offset value for the latter. This simplifies the analysis. Probabilities are used to inform an activity-level Bayesian Network that takes account of alternative propositions e.g. time of assault and time of social activities. The model is extended in order to take account of multiple contacts between person of interest and ’victim’. Variables taken into account include probabilities of direct and secondary transfer, along with background DNA from unknown individuals. The logistic regression analysis is Bayesian — for each analysis, 4000 separate simulations were carried out. Quantile assignments enable calculation of a plausible range of probabilities and sensitivity analysis is used to describe the corresponding variation of LRs that occur when modelled by the Bayesian network. It is noted that there is need for consistent experimental design, and analysis, to facilitate inter-laboratory comparisons. Appropriate recommendations are made. The open-source program written in R-code ALTRaP (Activity Level, Transfer, Recovery and Persistence) enables analysis of complex multiple transfer propositions that are commonplace in cases-work e.g. between those who cohabit. A number of case examples are provided. ALTRaP can be used to replicate the results and can easily be modified to incorporate different sets of data and variables.},

While direct contact and deposition may be a likely explanation, alternative scenarios involving DNA transfer through a secondary person or medium are important to consider. Here we assessed whether non-self DNA, indirectly transferred via a handshake, could be detected on surfaces contacted by the opposing hand-shaker after 15 min, and considered the variables affecting its persistence in subsequent contacts. In general, the depositor of the handprint was the major contributor to DNA profiles collected from handprints placed on glass plates. Minor contributions from the opposing hand-shaker (as a known contributor) were detected at a lower rate, decreasing as the number of contacted items increased post-handshake. Delays in deposition also affected the detection of the opposing hand-shaker, with a 15 min delay between handshaking and contact resulting in the reduced presence, and corresponding LRs, of the known contributor. The handprint depositor was excluded from their own handprint on several occasions, including instances where the opposing hand-shaker was not excluded from the same profile. Several factors appeared to strongly influence the detection of both the depositor and contributing individual involved in the handshake. The relative shedding ability of the pair had the largest effect, where good shedders (whether depositor or contributor) could swamp poor to moderate shedders, while the pairing of two moderate or two poor shedders could result in the detection of both individuals. When the deposition of a handprint was delayed, the activities performed by the individual had a substantial effect on the resultant detection of the contributing profile – multiple contacts with the same items increased the likelihood that the known contributor's DNA would be retained and subsequently detected, through the parking and re-transfer of DNA on used items.},

	abstract = {Cellular material derived from contact traces can be transferred via many direct and indirect routes, with the manner of contact and the time of transfer (in relation to the alleged crime-event) having an impact on whether DNA is recovered from the surface and a reportable profile generated. In an effort to acquire information on the transfer and recovery of DNA traces from clothing items worn during scenarios commonly encountered in casework, upper garments were worn during a normal working day before individuals were paired to embrace one another (‘contact’), go on an outing together (‘close proximity’), or individually asked to spend a day in another person's environment (‘physical absence’). Each prescribed activity was repeated by sixteen individuals across four countries, and was the last activity performed before the garment was removed. Samples were collected from several areas of the upper garments and processed from DNA extraction through to profiling within the laboratory of the country in which the individual resided. Activities relating to the garment prior to and during wearing, including the prescribed activity, were recorded by the participant and considered during the interpretation of results. In addition to obtaining reference profiles from the wearer and their activity partner, DNA profiles from the wearers’ close associates identified in the questionnaire were obtained to assess the impact of background DNA transferred prior to the prescribed activity. The wearer was typically, but not always, observed as the major contributor to the profiles obtained. DNA from the activity partner was observed on several areas of the garment following the embrace and after temporarily occupying another person's space. Particular areas of the garment were more prone to acquiring the hugging partner or office owner's DNA than others, and whether they were observed as the major or minor component was activity dependent. For each of the pairs, no DNA from the activity partner was acquired by the garments during the outing, even though both participants were in close proximity. This study provides empirical data on the transfer, persistence, prevalence and recovery of DNA from clothing items, and enables a better understanding of the mechanisms which lead to the transfer and detectability of DNA traces in different scenarios.},

	abstract = {The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as "What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose a Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be indexed. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages: first to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na{\textbackslash}"ive RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is forthcoming at https://aka.ms/graphrag.},

With the limited ability of traditional association-based computational methods to discover causal relationships, cSD methodologies are gaining popularity. the goal of the study was to systematically examine whether (i) cSD methods can discover the known causal relationships from observational clinical data and (ii) to offer guidance to accurately discover known causal relationships. We used Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex progressive disease, as a model because the well-established evidence provides a "gold-standard" causal graph for evaluation. We evaluated two cSD methods, fast causal inference (fci) and fast Greedy equivalence Search (fGeS) in their ability to discover this structure from data collected by the Alzheimer's Disease neuroimaging initiative (ADni). We used structural equation models (which is not designed for cSD) as control. We applied these methods under three scenarios defined by increasing amounts of background knowledge provided to the methods. the methods were evaluated by comparing the resulting causal relationships with the "gold standard" graph that was constructed from literature. Dedicated cSD methods managed to discover graphs that nearly coincided with the gold standard. for best results, cSD algorithms should be used with longitudinal data providing as much prior knowledge as possible.},

	abstract = {Bayesian networks (BNs) are a kind of graphical model that formally combines elements of graph and probability theory. BNs are a mathematically and statistically rigorous technique allowing their user to define a pictorial representation of assumed dependencies and influences among a set of variables deemed to be relevant for a particular inferential problem. The formalism allows one to process newly acquired evidence according to the rules of probability calculus. Applications of BNs have been reported in various forensic disciplines. However, there seems to be some reluctance to consider BNs as a more general framework for representing and evaluating sources of uncertainties associated with scientific evidence. Notably, BNs are widely thought of as an essentially numerical method, requiring "exact" numbers with a high "accuracy". The present paper aims to draw the reader's attention to the point that the availability of hard numerical data is not a necessary requirement for using BNs in forensic science. An abstraction of quantitative BNs, known as qualitative probabilistic networks (QPNs), and sensitivity analyses are presented and their potential applications discussed. As a main difference to their quantitative counterpart, QPNs contain qualitative probabilistic relationships instead of numerical relations. Sensitivity analyses consist of varying the probabilities assigned to one or more variables and evaluating the effect on one or more other variables of interest. Both QPNs and sensitivity analyses appear to be useful concepts that permit one to work in contexts with acute lack of numerical data and where reasoning consistent with the laws of probability should nevertheless be performed. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Paper I of this series of papers intends to contribute to the discussion of Bayesian networks as a framework that is helpful for both illustrating and implementing statistical procedures that are commonly employed for the study of uncertainties (e.g. the estimation of unknown quantities). While the respective statistical procedures are widely described in literature, the primary aim of this paper is to offer an essentially non-technical introduction on how interested readers may use these analytical approaches - with the help of Bayesian networks - for processing their own forensic science data. Attention is mainly drawn to the structure and underlying rationale of a series of basic and context-independent network fragments that users may incorporate as building blocs while constructing larger inference models. As an example of how this may be done, the proposed concepts will be used in a second paper (Part II) for specifying graphical probability networks whose purpose is to assist forensic scientists in the evaluation of scientific evidence encountered in the context of forensic document examination (i.e. results of the analysis of black toners present on printed or copied documents). © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {Understanding the variables impacting DNA transfer, persistence, prevalence and recovery (DNA-TPPR) has become increasingly relevant in investigations of criminal activities to provide opinion on how the DNA of a person of interest became present within the sample collected. This review considers our current knowledge regarding DNA-TPPR to assist casework investigations of criminal activities. There is a growing amount of information available on DNA-TPPR to inform the relative probabilities of the evidence given alternative scenarios relating to the presence or absence of DNA from a specific person in a collected sample of interest. This information should be used where relevant. However, far more research is still required to better understand the variables impacting DNA-TPPR and to generate more accurate probability estimates of generating particular types of profiles in more casework relevant situations. This review explores means of achieving this. It also notes the need for all those interacting with an item of interest to have an awareness of DNA transfer possibilities post criminal activity, to limit the risk of contamination or loss of DNA. Appropriately trained forensic practitioners are best placed to provide opinion and guidance on the interpretation of profiles at the activity level. However, those requested to provide expert opinion on DNA-related activity level issues are often insufficiently trained to do so. We advocate recognition of DNA activity associated expertise to be distinct from expertise associated with the identification of individuals. This is to be supported by dedicated training, competency testing, authorisation, and regular fit for purpose proficiency testing. The possibilities for experts to report on activity-related issues will increase as our knowledge increases through further research, access to relevant data is enhanced, and tools to assist interpretations are better exploited. Improvement opportunities will be achieved sooner, if more laboratories and agencies accept the need to invest in these aspects as well as the training of practitioners.},

Although it is a topic with a long history, it has never been considered to be such a critically important topic for the field, as today. With the increasing sensitivity of analysis techniques, and advances in data interpretation using probabilistic models (‘probabilistic genotyping’), there is an increasing demand on forensic biologists to share specialised knowledge to help recipients of expert information address mode and timing of transfer and persistence of traces in court. Scientists thereby have a critical role in the assessment of their findings in the context of the case. This helps the judiciary with activity level inferences in a balanced, robust and transparent way, when based on (1) proper case assessment and interpretation respecting the hierarchy of propositions (supported by, for example, the use of Bayesian networks as graphical models), (2) use of appropriate data to inform probabilities, and (3) reporting guidelines by international bodies. This critical review of current literature shows that with certain prerequisites for training and quality assurance, there is a solid foundation for evidence interpretation when propositions of interest are at the ‘activity level’.},

The issues surrounding questions of the kind “whose DNA is this?” have been the subject of considerable controversy but now it is clear that the emphasis is shifting to questions of the kind “how did this DNA get here?” Such issues are discussed in this paper and new insights are provided by two particular recent developments. First, the notion of the “hierarchy of propositions” that has arisen from a project called Case Assessment and Interpretation (CAI) that has been running in the British Forensic Science Service (FSS). Second, a technique for drawing inferences in the face of many interacting considerations, known as “Bayesian networks”— or “Bayes' nets“ for short—that has been the subject of an earlier paper in this journal (1). The discussion is carried out by means of case studies, based on actual cases. It is clear that, whereas the inference in relation to the source of the DNA in a crime sample might be overwhelmingly strong, the inference in relation to the propositions that a jury must consider relating to the identity of the actual offender may be much more tentative.},

Accordingly, the argument often made in criminal courts is not who the DNA belongs to but rather how it was deposited. Despite the complexity of the relevant DNA transfer, persistence, prevalence, and recovery issues, forensic laboratories in some European countries have used evaluative reports with activity level propositions, while this is not current practice in the United States. The purpose of this study was to gain an overview of the opinions about activity level reporting (ALR) held by forensic biologists in the United States. A seventeen-question survey was distributed to members of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors and U.S. members of the International Society for Forensic Genetics. The survey included multiple-choice and open-response questions and received 54 responses. The majority of responses expressed moderate support of ALR. Participants mentioned six major concerns to be addressed prior to implementing ALR in the United States: (1) effect of number of variables involved; (2) need of education for practitioners/legal system; (3) inadequate number of activity studies with realistic scenarios; (4) difficulty of achieving admissibility in court; (5) need for standardized approaches/guidelines; and (6) requisite shift in perspective as to the validity of ALR. Overall, this small segment of U.S. forensic DNA practitioners appear to be willing to implement ALR once these concerns are fully addressed and resolved. As a follow-up, it would be worthwhile exploring these and other questions with a larger group and also other disciplines.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The sensitivity of DNA analysis has progressed to the point that trace levels of DNA, originating from only a few cells, can generate informative profiles. This means that virtually any item or surface can be sampled with a reasonable chance of obtaining a DNA profile. As the presence of DNA does not suggest how it was deposited, questions are often raised as to how the DNA came to be at a particular location and the activity that led to its deposition. Therefore, understanding different modes of DNA deposition, reflective of realistic forensic casework situations, is critical for proper evaluation of DNA results in court. This study aimed to follow the movements of DNA to and from individuals and common household surfaces in a residential premises, while socially interacting. This took place over an hour and involved four participants, with known shedder status, designated as visitors (a male and a female) and hosts (a male and a female), who engaged in the activity of playing a board game while being served food. During the study, the participants were instructed to use the toilet on a single occasion to assess the transfer of DNA to new and unused underwear that was provided. All contacts made by the participants in the dining room and kitchen were video recorded to follow the movements of DNA. Samples were collected based on the history of contact, which included hands, fingernails and penile swabs. Direct contacts resulted in detectable transfer (LR {\textgreater} 1) in 87 \% (87/100) of the non-intimate samples and clothing. For surfaces touched by multiple participants, DNA from the person who made the last contact was not always detectable. The duration and number of contacts did not significantly affect the detection of the person contacting the item. On the other hand, presence of background DNA and participant's shedder status appear to play an important role. Further, unknown contributors were detected in the majority of samples. Finally, indirect transfer was observed on a number of occasions including co-habiting partners of guests who were not present at the study location. The results of this study may assist with decision making for exhibit selection or targeting areas for sampling within the home environment. Our findings can also be used in conjunction with previous literature to develop activity-level evaluations in such situations where the source of the DNA is conceded, but the mode of deposition is disputed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {For many criminal cases, the source of who deposited the DNA is not what the prosecutor and the defense are trying to dispute. In court, the question may be how the DNA was deposited at the crime scene rather than who the DNA came from. Although laboratories in many countries have begun to evaluate DNA evidence given formal activity-level propositions (ALPs), it is unknown how much other forensic practitioners know and what they think about activity-level evaluative reporting (ALR). To collect this information, a survey with 21 questions was submitted to international forensic science organizations across Europe, Australia, South America, Canada, Asia, and Africa. The survey combined open-ended and multiple-choice questions and received 162 responses. Responses revealed a wide range of knowledge on the topic. Overall, most respondents were somewhat knowledgeable about ALR, ALP, and current practices in court and expressed their support of the concept. A majority of participants identified gaps and obstacles regarding ALR they would like to see addressed. Examples include (1) need for more education/training at all stakeholder levels, (2) need for more DNA evidence-related data under realistic case scenarios, (3) need to internally implement and validate a formalized and objective approach for reporting, and (4) in some countries the need to achieve court admissibility. This global survey gathered the current concerns of forensic DNA practitioners and outlined several operational concerns. The information can be used to advance the implementation of ALR in laboratories and court testimony worldwide.},

	abstract = {The ENFSI (European Network of Forensic Science Institutes, http://www.enfsi.eu/) is a key organisation in Europe bringing together more than 60 laboratories with a vision to share common quality standards and exchange knowledge and expertise. Twenty years after its foundation, ENFSI is now a pre-eminent voice on forensic science in Europe with privileged relationships with institutions such as the European Commission (with the privileged status of an EU-monopolist), Europol, CEPOL, Eurojust and Interpol. A diversity of approaches in the assessment of the scientific findings Compare these two statements taken from practice: (1) The matching glass fragments recovered on the garment of Mr S. are consistent with coming from the broken window. (2) The matching glass fragments recovered on the garment of Mr S. are more likely to be found if Mr S. broke the window rather than if he had nothing to do with the incident. The first statement only considers the results given one version of the events and thus is unbalanced and potentially misleading. The second statement offers a relative assessment of the findings given two stated scenarios. Such diversity is easy to observe among the members of the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI). The ENFSI working groups deal with areas of practice such as firearms, drugs, biological traces (DNA), marks (fingerprints, footwear), documents, microtraces (glass, fibres, hair, soils, plants), explosives, audio (voice), video (face, gait) and digital information, crime scene investigation, road accidents and fire investigation. These are the areas targeted by the ENFSI Guideline. This diversity has adverse consequences. First, the lack of declared common criteria-and adherence thereto-for assessing and reporting scientific findings offers no guarantee that the scientific findings are assessed consistently and within a logical framework. For example, the same findings could lead practitioners to express conclusions that convey drastically different messages: from an undefined and prone to misinterpretation "match and consistent with" to a transparent disclosure of the weight to be attached to the findings. Ambiguous wording of scientific conclusions has been recognised as a factor leading to miscarriages of justice.},

	abstract = {Daubert skews the contribution of forensic science because it only took into account its Galilean dimension (construction of general predictive models). However, forensic science should better be classified in the historical sciences (clinical approach to reconstruct a past event of presence or activity). We therefore need a complementary approach that integrates the necessarily “clinical” part in the resolution of forensic issues. Such an evolution involves semiotics. While recognizing that the Bayesian way of thinking is the only prescriptive available model for interpretation fitting well in the Galilean paradigm, the complexity of the reconstruction of a past‐uncontrolled singular case and the robustness of available relevant data to it, invites consideration of its implementation in a semiotic line of arguments. Indeed, Bayes makes it possible to remain in a single harmonized model integrating both the clinical and Galilean dimensions, but rapidly the complexity of the modeling and its mathematization come up against more qualitative natural and legal reasoning. Two different systems of reasoning at stake are inevitably creating a “bug” that could explain the current forensic crisis and miscarriages of justice. This anomaly is reflected in the issue of transparency (misunderstandings by and between interlocutors on the nature of the expertise, if not science). Peirce offers a path to address the tension between complementary reasoning systems.

	abstract = {In criminal trials, evidence often involves a degree of uncertainty and decision-making includes moving from the initial presumption of innocence to inference about guilt based on that evidence. The jurors’ ability to combine evidence and make accurate intuitive probabilistic judgments underpins this process. Previous research has shown that errors in probabilistic reasoning can be explained by a misalignment of the evidence presented with the intuitive causal models that people construct. This has been explored in abstract and context-free situations. However, less is known about how people interpret evidence in context-rich situations such as legal cases. The present study examined participants’ intuitive probabilistic reasoning in legal contexts and assessed how people’s causal models underlie the process of belief updating in the light of new evidence. The study assessed whether participants update beliefs in line with Bayesian norms and if errors in belief updating can be explained by the causal structures underpinning the evidence integration process. The study was based on a recent case in England where a couple was accused of intentionally harming their baby but was eventually exonerated because the child’s symptoms were found to be caused by a rare blood disorder. Participants were presented with a range of evidence, one piece at a time, including physical evidence and reports from experts. Participants made probability judgments about the abuse and disorder as causes of the child’s symptoms. Subjective probability judgments were compared against Bayesian norms. The causal models constructed by participants were also elicited. Results showed that overall participants revised their beliefs appropriately in the right direction based on evidence. However, this revision was done without exact Bayesian computation and errors were observed in estimating the weight of evidence. Errors in probabilistic judgments were partly accounted for, by differences in the causal models representing the evidence. Our findings suggest that understanding causal models that guide people’s judgments may help shed light on errors made in evidence integration and potentially identify ways to address accuracy in judgment.},

This study focussed on the transfer, persistence, and prevalence of trace DNA in a single occupation of an office space by an intruder, when all contacts made during occupation and for the two hours prior and post occupation were known. The extent to which DNA could be recovered from contacted/not contacted surfaces was investigated. This study investigates the impacts of these movements and use of an office space when the duration of occupancy, surface contact histories and shedder status of participants are known. Contacts were documented and surfaces in the office space were targeted for sampling. Categories were set for target sampling that included different types of contact. Direct and indirect DNA transfer was detected in 55 \% and 6 \% of samples, respectively. Contactless DNA transfer was detected in 0.5 \% of samples. The owner was observed as the sole/major/majority contributor in 77 \% of the samples and as minor contributor in 10 \% of samples. The intruder was observed as the sole/major/majority contributor in 14 \% of samples and as the minor contributor in 16 \%. An increased number of contacts increased the relative DNA contribution of the individual making the contact, however, not all observed direct contacts resulted in detectable DNA transfer. The outcome of this study will aid in better sample targeting strategies and contribute to the pool of data assisting in the development of activity level assessments.},

	abstract = {Considerations concerning how DNA recovered from a crime scene was deposited are of increasing significance to forensic casework. While the possibility of indirect DNA transfer is well established, research into such transfer is limited and focused mainly on the handling of DNA-free items. This study investigated whether secondarily-transferred DNA can be detected on regularly-used items, and if so, for how long might it persist. Volunteers each used a set of knives regularly over a period of two days, after which, each of these ‘regular users’ shook hands with another person (‘handshaker’) and then immediately, without touching anything else, repeatedly stabbed one of their own regularly-used knives into foam for 60 s. DNA was recovered from the knife handles using mini-tapes approximately one hour, one day, and one week after the stabbings. In three of the four pairings of volunteers, complete and partial DNA profiles matching those of the regular user and handshaker respectively, at ratios of ∼10:1, were recovered from the knives within one hour. Alleles attributed to the handshaker were still detected after one week, but were significantly reduced in number and peak height for two of the three pairings. Unknown alleles were also recovered from the knives, suggesting other indirect DNA transfer events. These included repeated detection of alleles attributed to the DNA profile of a volunteer's partner. For the fourth pairing, only complete single-source DNA profiles matching the regular user's profile were recovered. This study demonstrates that, on regularly-used items, secondarily-transferred DNA can be detected and can persist for at least a week; this has implications for forensic reconstructions.},

This pilot study aimed to improve our understanding of DNA TPPR associated with domestic dogs by collecting and analysing samples from various external areas of dogs of various breeds, interactions with humans, and living arrangements, and conducting a series of tests to investigate the possibility of dogs being vectors for the indirect transfer of human DNA. Reference DNA profiles from the dog owners and others living in the same residence were acquired to assist interpretation of the findings. The findings show that human DNA is prevalent on dogs, and in the majority of samples, two-person mixtures are present.

A robust protocol was established to generate a set of substrates with a controlled linear surface roughness range (0.5-3.5 µm) in order to identify the impact of surface roughness on DNA transfer, persistence, prevalence, and recovery (DNA-TPPR). The polypropylene substrate was shown to produce fibres when artificially roughened, becoming more prominent at a higher surface roughness range, and has shown to have a direct impact on the distribution of salivary and touch deposits. At the low to moderate surface roughness range 0.5-2.0 µm, salivary and touch deposits have generally shown to follow the topographical features of the substrate they were deposited on, before a plateau of the surface roughness measure on the deposit was observed, indicating that a saturation point was reached and the grooves in the substrate were beginning to fill. Touch deposits have shown to maintain a consistent deposition height pre-surface roughness threshold, irrespective of substrate surface roughness while the deposition height of salivary deposits was heavily influenced by substrate surface roughness and topography. The substrate SFE, wettability, hydrophobicity, and the surface tension of the deposit was shown to drive the adhesion properties of the saliva and touch deposits on the respective substrates, and it was observed that this may be of importance for the improvement of the current DNA-TPPR understanding, DNA sampling protocols, and DNA transfer considerations within casework.},

While the evidence of a DNA trace is seldom challenged in court by a defendant’s legal team, concerns are often raised about how the DNA was transferred to the location of the crime. This review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the experimental work carried out focusing on indirect DNA transfer, analyzing each selected paper, the experimental method, the sampling technique, the extraction protocol, and the main results. Scopus and Web of Science databases were used as the search engines, including 49 papers. Based on the results of this review, one of the factors that influence secondary transfer is the amount of DNA shed by different individuals. Another factor is the type and duration of contact between individuals or objects (generally, more intimate or prolonged contact results in more DNA transfer). A third factor is the nature and quality of the DNA source. However, there are exceptions and variations depending on individual characteristics and environmental conditions. Considering that secondary transfer depends on multiple factors that interact with each other in unpredictable ways, it should be considered a complex and dynamic phenomenon that can affect forensic investigation in various ways, for example, placing a subject at a crime scene who has never been there. Correct methods and protocols are required to detect and prevent secondary transfer from compromising forensic evidence, as well as the correct interpretation through Bayesian networks. In this context, the definition of well-designed experimental studies combined with the use of new forensic techniques could improve our knowledge in this challenging field, reinforcing the value of DNA evidence in criminal trials.},

	abstract = {Due to legal and privacy-related restrictions, the generation of synthetic data is recommended for creating datasets for digital forensic education and training. One challenge when synthesizing scenario-based forensic data is the creation of coherent background activity besides evidential actions. This work leverages the creative writing abilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate personas and actions that describe the background usage of a device consistent with the created persona. These actions are subsequently converted into a machine-readable format and executed on a virtualized device using VM control automation. We introduce Re-imagen, a framework that combines state-of-the-art LLMs and a recent unintrusive GUI automation tool to produce synthetic disk images that contain arguably coherent “wear-and-tear” artifacts that current synthesis platforms lack. While, for now, the focus is on the coherence of the generated background activity, we believe that the proposed approach is a step toward more realistic synthetic disk image generation.},

A total of 594 hand swab extracts from 297 participants throughout Europe and the United States of America were analyzed using Ion Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry. The data provides a reference framework for future covert investigations and forensic casework. The results indicate that thiocyanate, chlorate, nitrite, lithium, strontium, and barium are rarely detected on the hands of individuals who have had no direct contact with explosives (P{\textless}0.03) and in quantities below 6 µg. Perchlorate contamination sporadically occurs without deliberately handling perchlorates (P=0.03), albeit at low levels ({\textless}12 µg). It also seems that the presence of perchlorate on hands is generally related to professions that involve explosives. Detecting substantial amounts of any of these rare ions on a suspect’s hands would require a specific explanation. Because legitimate activities exist that can also result in elevated levels of ions of interest on hands, the context surrounding their presence has to be carefully assessed for each individual case.},

There have been a number of publications that describe sensitivity analysis in technical terms, and demonstrate their use, but limited literature on how that theory can be applied in practice. In this work we provide some simplified examples of how sensitivity analyses can be carried out, when they are likely to show that the evaluation is sensitive to underlying data, knowledge or assumptions, how to interpret the results of sensitivity analysis, and how the outcome can be reported.

If such a possibility exists, and the case circumstances are such that the area on an exhibit where DNA is present or absent is an observation that is an important diagnostic characteristic given the propositions, then site to site transfer should be taken into account during the evaluation of observations. In this work we demonstrate the ways in which site to site transfer can be built into Bayesian networks when carrying out activity level evaluations of forensic biology findings.

In this study we share the results from a retrospective analysis of 74 of such requests. We explore which party initiates requests, the types of cases that are submitted, the sources of data being used to assign probabilities to DNA transfer, persistence, prevalence and recovery (TPPR) events, the conclusions that were drawn by the scientists, and how the conclusions were used by the courts. This retrospective analysis of cases demonstrates that published sources of data are generally available and can be used to address DNA TPPR events in most cases, although significant gaps still remain. The study furthermore shows that reporting on forensic biology findings given activity level propositions has been generally accepted by the district and appeal courts, as well as the other parties in the criminal justice system in the Netherlands.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of the results from a fibre comparison given activity level propositions is well established when considering only a single group of potential primary transfers. However, secondary transfers are less prevalent in the literature despite their potential value, especially in cases where the primary transfers are not sufficiently informative. In particular, one can consider the fibres from frequented environments of the person of interest (POI) identified in a struggle. If the POI did struggle with the complainant, these fibres can potentially be recovered in small quantities on the surface of the complainant as a result of secondary or higher order transfers. Therefore, these fibres may provide useful information that can resolve competing propositions involving struggles, as well as forensic intelligence in the form of linkages or investigative leads. If a non-differentiation is indeed found between recovered fibres and fibres from the frequented environments of the POI, these results need to be properly interpreted. In this paper, a model, based on an object oriented Bayesian network (OOBN), for evaluating such findings along with its implementation is proposed. Using available data from the literature and other sources, the model was then used to assess a few hypothetical scenarios involving secondary transfers. The results provided useful insights into secondary transfer that help to validate the model and demonstrate the potential utility that can be gained by considering transfers beyond the primary order. Moreover, these results can be used to help guide future research by identifying gaps in the literature. Finally, the direct application to a case study was conducted to demonstrate the practical aspects of such a model.},

Regardless of the cause, other than scientific opinion, there is currently no analytical technique that can satisfactorily address the provenance of methamphetamine residues. For several years, approximate methamphetamine contamination levels have been collected from suspected clandestine laboratories in New Zealand, where methamphetamine is believed to have been manufactured. This study used this data and compared it to similar data from properties where the drug is suspected to have been used (smoked) to model likelihood ratios (LR). It is well documented that the LR forms the backbone to a Bayesian method of interpreting forensic evidence. As such, this data has the potential to underpin a novel Bayesian approach in the evaluation of clandestine laboratory evidence.},

This study considered the potential for background levels of semen in the washing machine and the levels of semen transferred with varying laundry storage and washing arrangements. The results concur with previous studies that low levels of spermatozoa can transfer during washing; however, this study demonstrated that background levels of semen can be present on children’s clothing during domestic laundering activities which include male underwear when there are sexually active males within the household. Further, that semen can persist in the washing machine even after three washes.

	abstract = {For evidence evaluation of the physicochemical properties of glass at activity level a well-known formula introduced by Evett \& Buckleton [1,2] is commonly used. Parameters in this formula are, amongst others, the probability in a background population to find on somebody’s clothing the observed number of glass sources and the probability in a background population to find on somebody’s clothing a group of fragments with the same size as the observed matching group. Recently, for efficiency reasons, the Netherlands Forensic Institute changed its methodology to measure not all the glass fragments but a subset of glass fragments found on clothing. Due to the measurement of subsets, it is difficult to get accurate estimates for these parameters in this formula. We offer a solution to this problem. The heart of the solution consists of relaxing the assumption of conditional independence of group sizes of background fragments, and modelling the probability of an allocation of background fragments into groups given a total number of background fragments by a two-parameter Chinese restaurant process (CRP) [3]. Under the assumption of random sampling of fragments to be measured from recovered fragments in the laboratory, parameter values for the Chinese restaurant process may be estimated from a relatively small dataset of glass in other relevant cases. We demonstrate this for a dataset of glass fragments collected from upper garments in casework, show model fit and provide a prototypical calculation of an LR at activity level accompanied with a parameter sensitivity analysis for reasonable ranges of the CRP parameter values. Considering that other laboratories may want to measure subsets as well, we believe this is an important alternative approach to the evaluation of numerical LRs for glass analyses at activity level.},

Given that the dispute concerns the nature of the activity that took place or the identity of the actor that carried out the activity, several factors will determine how to formulate the propositions. Determining factors are (1) whether defense claims the crime never took place, (2) whether defense claims someone other than the accused (either an unknown individual or a known person) performed the criminal activity, and (3) whether it is claimed and disputed that the suspect performed an alternative, legitimate activity or has a relation to the victim, the object, or the scene of crime that implies a legitimate interaction.

Previous studies have evaluated the distribution of spray paint droplets in closed space, on clothing, and its persistence following washing. Yet, due to the difficulty in observing and counting them under a stereomicroscope, the previous studies had to limit the tests conducted and limit the amount of data collected. In this paper, we perform simulations of spraying using a fluorescent paint and a computer-automated extraction of features and counting of the droplets. With these tools we were able to perform many different tests in a relatively small amount of time and gather data about the density, distribution, and size of the droplets transferred. We discuss the obtained results and hypothesize that such evaluations of the transferred droplets would permit to distinguish between different scenarios at an activity level, such as the presence on the scene as a simple witness or bystander, versus the illicit action of spraying a graffiti or a tag.},

	abstract = {The analysis of gunshot residues (GSR) can provide important information with regard to the involvement of a person of interest (POI) in a firearm-related incident. Organic gunshot residues (OGSR) have been investigated in order to provide additional and complementary information to the traditional inorganic gunshot residue (IGSR) particles detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Currently, many procedures and analytical methods have been developed to detect OGSR-related compounds collected from the shooter’s hands. However, such studies provide no information regarding the inclusion of such results in an activity level evaluation for discharging a firearm. The aim of this article is to assess the feasibility of using the likelihood ratio (LR) approach as a tool to evaluate OGSR results for activity level propositions. The developed model focuses on the assignment of an LR for several compounds detected in OGSR. A simple worst-case simulation was investigated in order to assess the applicability of the LR approach to evaluate OGSR traces. This simulation highlighted the importance of addressing an appropriate pair of activity level propositions when evaluating the results.},

Probabilistic analysis of the GSR results provides more value to the court, so the present study calculated likelihood ratio (LR) values for finding 0–8 characteristic GSR particles (containing Lead, Barium and Antimony) on a suspect's hands, based on the available GSR data from the published literature as well as studies by the authors. Defense propositions, i.e. modes for GSR acquisition other than involvement in a shooting event, were divided into three broad categories: low, medium and heavy background. For each background level and number of GSR particles found, minimal and maximal LR values were calculated. Thus, for each proposition the defense provides for the presence of GSR on the defendant's hands, the forensic expert can provide a possible set of minimal and maximal LR values, leaving the court to examine the defendant's contention and decide which of the three background modes is more plausible according to the circumstances of the specific case.},

	abstract = {Coulson et al. [1] proposed methodology for the estimation of the P and S terms used in glass interpretation when assessing the value of the findings given activity level propositions. These terms arise in a model proposed by Evett [2], Evett and Buckleton [3], and are based on survey data. Specifically they proposed a model for estimating Pk, k = 0, 1, 2, … and Sn, n = 1, 2, where Pk is the probability of finding k distinct sources (or groups) of glass on a person of interest (POI), and Sn is the probability that the kth source consists of n fragments. In this article we make a number of extensions to the work of Coulson et al. [1]. Firstly we derive an estimate of the uncertainty in the parameter of the Coulson et al. model, and show how this may be used—for example, to compute an estimate of how the probabilities may vary or how to compare estimates resulting from different surveys. Secondly, we extend the model by allowing a more sensible modelling of the “excess” zeros (in the case of the P terms) and excess ones (in the case of the S terms). The methodology used to make these extensions relies on purely frequentist theory of estimation in keeping with the original work. A Bayesian approach to estimation will be the subject of future work. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of an R (R Core Team, [4]) package, called fitPS (Curran, [5]) which makes the methodology described in this article easy to implement in practice.},

Currently a forensic practitioner conducts this testing by manually performing the stabbing action. A biomechanics performance trial was conducted to evaluate how a range of human factors contribute to the creation of textile damage by stabbing actions. Surveys of sharp force fatalities and clinical penetrative injuries reported the chest and abdomen as the most frequent target location for stab wounds. The location of the cut-type damage recorded during the trial was found to correlate to the location of stab injuries incurred during actual stabbing cases. The type of weapon had an impact on the actions undertaken. Participants mostly utilised the smaller utility and hunting knives in underarm thrusting or overarm hacking actions, whereas an overarm hacking action, or combined hacking/slashing action was performed when using the machete. The familiarity of the knife, shape of the handle and perceived risk of injury determined how the handle was held. Participants frequently stabbed into the target immediately in front of their dominant hand, however care should be taken in interpreting this in a casework scenario. The machete was used with the highest mean velocity, and the utility knife the lowest.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            The ReAct (Recovery, Activity) project is an ENFSI (European Network of Forensic Science Institutes) supported initiative comprising a large consortium of laboratories. Here, the results from more than 23 laboratories are presented. The primary purpose was to design experiments simulating typical casework circumstances; collect data and to implement Bayesian networks to assess the value (i.e., likelihood ratio) of DNA results given activity level propositions. Two different experimental designs were used to simulate a robbery, where a screwdriver was used to force a door or window. Propositions and case information were chosen following laboratory feedback listing typical casework circumstances (included in the paper). Whereas the proposition representing prosecution’s view is applicable to many cases: the defendant forced the door/window with his screwdriver; the proposition representing defence’s view are more variable depending on what is alleged to have happened. In a direct transfer experiment, the defendant owned and used the screwdriver, but he did not force the door/window in question. An unknown person used the defendant’s stolen screwdriver. In an indirect transfer experiment, the defendant neither owned, saw, nor used the screwdriver, nor did they force the door or window. Instead, an unknown individual—someone with whom the defendant had interacted (e.g., by shaking hands or touching the same objects)—used the recovered tool to force entry. In the first experiment, if the defendant forced the door/window, then s/he is the last handler of the screw driver, whereas if the tool was stolen and used by an unknown person, the defendant is the first handler. For the second experiment, given the defence view, the defendant never held the screwdriver. We envisaged the situation where an object manipulated by the defendant (or the defendant himself/herself) would be touched by the unknown offender who would then force the window. The time delay between the touching of the object and the forcing of the window was 0, 1h, and 2h. This was accomplished by handshaking experiments, where the person forcing the door would shake a person’s hand, and then use the screwdriver either immediately after hand-shake or after 1, 2 hours. It was found for the direct transfer experiment that unless a single contributor profile aligning with the known person’s of interest profile was retrieved, the results did not allow to discriminate propositions. On the other hand, for the indirect transfer experiment, both single and major contributor profiles that aligned with the person of interest (POI) supported the proposition that the person used the tool rather than an unknown person who had touched an object, when indeed the former was true. There was considerable variation in median recoveries of DNA between laboratories (between 200pg - 5ng) for a given experiment if quantities are taken into account. These differences affect the likelihood ratios given activity level propositions. More than 2,700 samples were analysed in the course of this study. Two different Bayesian Networks are made available via an open source application written in Shiny R:
            Shiny\_React()
            . For comparison, all datasets were analysed using a qualitative method categorised into absent, single, balanced or major given contributors.
          
          The need for standardisation of methods is highlighted, along with the need for new methods to assess probability of laboratory dependent DNA recovery. Open access databases that are made freely available are important adjuncts},

While statistical methods for the evaluation of forensic evidence, including glass, fingerprints, and DNA, have significantly contributed to solving intricate crimes, there is a notable lack of national-level standards to ensure the appropriate application of statistics in forensic investigations. We discuss the obstacles in the application of statistics in court, and emphasize the importance of making statistical interpretation accessible to non-statisticians, especially those who make decisions about potentially innocent individuals. We investigate the use and misuse of statistical methods in crime investigations, in particular the likelihood ratio approach. We further describe the use of graphical models, where hypotheses and evidence can be represented as nodes connected by arrows signifying association or causality. We emphasize the advantages of special graph structures, such as object-oriented Bayesian networks and chain event graphs, which allow for the concurrent examination of evidence of various nature.},

For that purpose, likelihood ratio equations are derived for four generic scenarios, in which the source frequency, the number of references and trace types investigated, and the number of matches vary. Previous experimental studies into the evaluation of fibre evidence are reviewed and we demonstrate how the results of these studies, as well as other data, can be used to evaluate the derived equations for the four scenarios. Evaluation is not straightforward and requires a number of assumptions. This is mainly because the relevant population under consideration in a specific case cannot be sufficiently evaluated. In addition, the subjective match-criterion in current forensic fibre examinations makes it impossible to implement a good evaluation of the within-variation of samples. As a result, the discrimination power, currently calculated for discrimination studies, is only valid for samples with negligible heterogeneity. We conclude that reporting a numerical evidential value for forensic fibre examinations is not yet feasible as the data are available for only a few types of fibres and cannot be used without several assumptions. We propose a number of developments that are required to improve the accuracy and numerical analysis.},

Thus, continuous variables are often discretized when learning a Bayesian network. However, the choice of discretization policy has signiﬁcant impact on the accuracy, speed, and interpretability of the resulting models. This paper introduces a principled Bayesian discretization method for continuous variables in Bayesian networks with quadratic complexity instead of the cubic complexity of other standard techniques. Empirical demonstrations show that the proposed method is superior to the established minimum description length algorithm. In addition, this paper shows how to incorporate existing methods into the structure learning process to discretize all continuous variables and simultaneously learn Bayesian network structures.},

	abstract = {The identification of biological fluids in forensic samples is a key requirement in forensic science that relies on chemical and biological tests, most of which exhibit some degree of false positivity. There is a notable lack of research into cross reactions of biological fluids in stains commonly found at crime scenes. In particular, this research focused on blood, semen, and saliva as possible sources of the analysed stains. Currently, forensic scientists rely on describing results using words such as probable, possible, and likely without always being able to provide robust statistical support for these conclusions. In this research we developed multiple Bayesian Networks to assist in creating an evaluative reporting framework that can address most cases related to blood, semen, and saliva at the source level. Constructed Networks for each of these sources were applied to case scenarios to demonstrate their efficacy.},

	abstract = {Most of the forensic evidence evaluations given activity level propositions are centered around an item which is assumed to be linked to an alleged activity. However, the relation between an item of interest and an activity may be contested. This study presents a template Bayesian network (BN) for the evaluation of transfer evidence given activity level propositions considering a dispute about the relation of an item to one or more activities. The template BN includes a set of association propositions that enables the combined evaluation of evidence concerning alleged activities of the suspect and evidence concerning the use of an alleged item in those activities. Since the two types of evidence are often from different forensic disciplines, the BN is especially useful in interdisciplinary casework. Throughout the paper, we use a fictive case example that captures the essence of cases for which the template model can be used. The template BN provides a flexible starting point that can be adapted to specific case situations and supports structured probabilistic reasoning by a forensic scientist.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

While initial studies have explored the potential of ChatGPT in the context of investigations, the question of to what extent LLMs can assist the forensic report writing process remains unresolved. To answer the question, this article first examines forensic reports with the goal of generalization (e.g., finding the ‘average structure’ of a report). We then evaluate the strengths and limitations of LLMs for generating the different parts of the forensic report using a case study. This work thus provides valuable insights into the automation of report writing, a critical facet of digital forensics investigations. We conclude that combined with thorough proofreading and corrections, LLMs may assist practitioners during the report writing process but at this point cannot replace them.},

	abstract = {One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than \$15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

However, trace and touch DNA samples, due to their nature, often have lower success rates than other biological materials, such as blood. Further, forensically aware criminals can utilize gloves and meticulously clean the crime scene to remove DNA traces of themselves from contacted surfaces. Air sampling offers a novel approach to the collection of human DNA that has the potential to bypass some of these issues. This study reports on the results of research into the prevalence and persistence of human DNA in the air. The ability to collect human DNA from the air was investigated with the use of an AirPrep Cub Sampler ACD220 in different spaces, with and without the presence of individuals for various durations of sample collection. Results of this study demonstrate that level of occupation and sampling duration each have an influence on quantity and quality of DNA recovered from the air whereas the effects of orientation and distance of participants from the collection device as well as sequence of occupation remain unclear and require further investigation.},

Digital forensic investigation requires the processing of tons of digital images collected on devices to either identify or validate the device’s user or to ascertain whether the operator has any connections to the case that would be of interest. Examining and evaluating heterogeneous activity presents several difficulties, including variability, complex interaction across information, and volume.

This research presents a hybrid optimization of the Grey Wolf and artificial bee colony (GW-ABC) optimization with deep learning model Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) i.e., GW-ABC-CNN, and the developed framework is integrated as a module for Autopsy software. The main objective of this research is to detect the heterogeneous activity of humans from the Heterogeneous Human Activity Recognition (HHAR) database. The developed model is integrated into the data-source ingest module; in this module, pre-processing, feature extraction, and detection process is performed. Moreover, in the pre-processing stage, the Min-Max normalization method is used and the required frequency and time features are extracted using the GW-ABC method. In addition, CNN is used to detect heterogeneous activity; this detection process is performed by four layers. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed model is assessed, and the outcomes of using the GW-ABC-CNN paradigm were compared to those of other strategies to evaluate the model’s effectiveness.},

Recently, questions regarding the possibility that domestic animals can serve as silent witnesses, from whom evidence can be collected, or act as vectors of contamination and transfer, have started to be raised. Yet, little is known regarding the transfer and prevalence of human DNA to and from cats. This study investigated if cats are reservoirs and vectors for human DNA transfer. Twenty cats from 15 households were sampled from 4 different areas (head (fur), back (fur), left (skin) and right (fur)) to obtain information on the background DNA that may be found on an animal. Further, transfer of human DNA to and from an animal, after a short patting contact, was tested. Human DNA was found to be prevalent on all cats. Of the areas sampled, most DNA was collected from the top of the fur from the back followed by the head and right/fur. No or very low quantities of human DNA was recovered from the left (skin) area. Most of the human DNA originated from the owners, but DNA from others was also often present (47 \% of samples). Further, the transfer tests demonstrated that human DNA transferred readily to (detected in 45 \% of samples) and from (detected in 80 \% of samples) cats during patting. These results show that animals can act as reservoirs of human DNA and vectors for human DNA transfer that may need to be considered during evaluative DNA reporting. Furthermore, if an interaction between an animal and a perpetrator is suspected, consideration should be given to collecting DNA evidence from suspected contact areas on an animal.},

In particular, we show how the method, which is based on a directed acyclic graph, enables dependencies between different aspects of the evidence to be considered. The discussion is based on an imaginary case example.},

We review the research and guidelines that have been published and provide examples of how to implement them in casework. After a discussion on uncertainty in the criminal trial and the roles that the DNA scientist may take, we present the principles of interpretation for evaluative reporting. We show how their application helps to avoid a common fallacy and present strategies that DNA scientists can apply so that they do not transpose the conditional. We then discuss the hierarchy of propositions and explain why it is considered a fundamental concept for the evaluation of biological results and the differences between assessing results given propositions that are at the source level or the activity level. We show the importance of pre-assessment, especially when the questions relate to the alleged activities, and when transfer and persistence need to be considered by the scientists to guide the court. We conclude with a discussion on statement writing and testimony. This provides guidance on how DNA scientists can report in a balanced, transparent, and logical way.},

	abstract = {“Shedder status” describes the inherent variation between individuals to leave touch DNA on a surface through direct contact. Depending on the amount and quality of DNA or cellular deposition, individuals are typically deemed high, intermediate, or low shedders. Although many shedder tests have been described, variability in study design and categorisation criteria has limited the ability of researchers to accurately compare results, as well as accrue the necessary population data. As activity level reporting becomes more common, the need for reliable and standardised testing increases. To assess reproducibility, this study compared shedder status data generated by six participants using three different shedder tests, as modified from the literature. This involved DNA quantification and profiling of a handprint made on a glass plate, DNA quantification and profiling of a grip mark made on a plastic conical tube, and cell scoring of a Diamond™ Dye-stained fingermark. All participants washed and dried their hands fifteen minutes before each deposit. To assess the impact of behaviour on shedder designation, participants either refrained from activity or went about their daily tasks during this wait. The shedder status of participants changed between tests, as DNA-based testing often generated lower shedder statuses than cell scores. Further, when different categorisation methods were applied to a single test, intra-person variability increased as the number of shedder designations increased from two (low/high) to five (low/low-intermediate/intermediate/intermediate-high/high). Moving forward, the utilisation of a single shedder test and standardised categorisation criteria is needed to employ shedder testing in forensic casework.},

	abstract = {A major factor that influences DNA transfer is the propensity of individuals to ‘shed’ DNA, commonly referred to as their ‘shedder status’. In this work we provide a novel method to analyse and interrogate DNA transfer data from a largely uncontrolled study that tracks the movements and actions of a group of individuals over the course of an hour. By setting up a model that provides a simplistic description of the world, parameters within the model that represent properties of interest can be iteratively refined until the model can sufficiently describe a set of final DNA observations. Because the model describing reality can be constructed and parametrised in any desired configuration, aspects that may be difficult to traditionally test together can be investigated. To that end, we use a 60-min timeline of activity between four individuals and use DNA profiling results from objects taken at the conclusion of the hour to investigate factors that may affect shedder status. We simultaneously consider factors of: the amount of DNA transferred per contact, the rate of self-DNA regeneration, the capacity of hands to hold DNA, and the rate of non-self-DNA removal, all of which may ultimately contribute to someone’s shedder status.},

	abstract = {Forensic science is underutilised. Operating models restricted to the support of court outcomes do not address core requirements of contemporary policing and public security, which are to disrupt criminal activity and prevent crime. Forensic intelligence (FORINT) is a principal means of enhancing the role of forensic science, emphasising proactivity and cross-case, cross-crime domain insights. To catalyse implementation, a FORINT Specialist Advisory Group (SAG) has been established under the Australia \& New Zealand Policing Advisory Agency (ANZPAA) National Institute of Forensic Science (NIFS). The SAG has established a concept of operations with four lines of effort – namely, to (i) promote awareness and consistency, (ii) shape the workforce, (iii) develop information management frameworks and (iv) guide operational implementation. This aims to shift Australia \& New Zealand from its present state (of substantial interagency variability) to a state of widespread, consistent and effective FORINT delivery in terms of: (a) culture, (b) information management, (c) education \& training, and (d) organisation \& operating environment. There are risks to implementing FORINT, in terms of privacy/confidentiality, bias/misinterpretation, and resource impost. However, these are not necessarily FORINT-specific, and solutions or mitigations exist. Moreover, these issues are outweighed by the risks of not implementing FORINT – such as a failure to reveal threats, missed opportunities, and poor resource efficiency. This paper is a call to arms. For policing and laboratories – now is the time to implement and entrench FORINT. For academia – now is the time to build foundations for this future. For supporting industries – now is the time to develop partnerships and facilitate delivery.},

Evidence such as DNA, fingerprints, fibers, accelerants, tyre marks, and so forth, can support to differing degrees the various working theories or hypotheses about the nature of the alleged crime, the persons of interest and the modus operandi. Investigators however, either forensic or detective, bring various biases to evidence capture and analysis, biases which are better understood in the intelligence community. Structured analytical techniques have a long history in intelligence analysis, for example analysis of competing hypotheses, which serves several purposes: information sharing, clarity of communication, and to highlight the common forms of bias brought to bear in an investigation. We illustrate the representation of links based on traces and intelligence, and how these can be stored in databases permitting better “reasoning” with evidence. We also present some recommendations for integration of forensic intelligence into the investigative analytic process and review information systems in this area.

Graphical methods can be used to show different scenarios that might explain the evidence in a case and to distinguish between evidence requiring evaluation by a jury and quantifiable evidence from the crime scene. Such visual representations can be helpful for forensic practitioners, police, and lawyers who may need to assess the value that different pieces of evidence make to their arguments.

We show how different evidence (i.e. expert judgement and data from a crime scene) can be combined using a CEG and show how the hierarchical model deriving from the graph can be used to evaluate the degree of support for different activity-level propositions in the case.

	abstract = {Due to the police commissioning of expert forensic services worldwide, the police may specify the level of forensic service they need; thus, forensic scientists can be put under pressure to present scientific findings as quickly as possible and in simple and definitive terms. Frequently, this means reporting forensics results out of the context of the case, as forensic practitioners may not be given relevant case information. However, to do so can be misleading, inaccurate and potentially lead to miscarriages of justice. Thus, whilst well-intentioned, efforts to accelerate and simplify forensic science evidence can undermine the justice system. However, providing that all forensic scientists and practitioners follow three basic forensic interpretation principles based on the formulation of the likelihood ratio component of Bayes Theorem approach, and are given case context, then the chances of miscarriages of justice arising from forensic science should be minimised. Principle \#1: Always consider at least one alternative hypothesis. Principle \#2: Always consider the probability of the evidence given the proposition and not the probability of the proposition given the evidence. Principle \#3: Always consider the framework of circumstance. The expression of a likelihood ratio lies at the core of a pre-assessment that, if used correctly, should minimise bias in the forensic investigation. Several disciplines use likelihood ratios to interpret their findings and place them in the context of the case. There are still several forensic science areas where this is not undertaken, and therefore they may be a source of concern.},

	abstract = {With the advances of analytical sensitivity, it is now possible to detect a DNA profile from minute quantity of DNA. It opens new investigative avenues (in cold cases for example), but also new interpretative challenges. Here, forensic scientists deal with items bearing DNA cellular material from areas showing no visible stain and have limited means to identify the nature of the body fluid involved. Such DNA cells can be considered as trace evidence that can be exchanged for reasons connected to the alleged facts under investigation (generally a direct transfer) but also following alternative and versatile ways (through secondary or tertiary transfer) that have no connection to the facts under investigation. The trace becomes an ubiquitous material that can be found for unconnected reasons. In addition, and especially with trace quantities of DNA, the debate in court is less focused on the issue of the source of the DNA (often the parties will not dispute it), but on the mechanisms whereby the biological material has been transferred (Taroni et al., 2013). In other words, the well-known territory of source level DNA statistics (see Buckleton et al. 2005, for example) does not help with the interpretation process, but the forensic scientist is invited to assess how likely it would be to observe this amount of DNA given various transfer mechanisms. The review by Meakin and Jamieson (2013) led them to conclude that the quantity of DNA or the quality of the profile cannot be used “to reliably infer the mode of transfer by which the DNA came to be on the surface of interest”.This rather complicated new landscape leads to two questions:(1) Is it the role of the scientist to offer guidance as to the probability of the DNA findings given various transfer mechanisms put forward by the parties depending on the case circumstances?(2) Can a forensic scientist robustly assess the probability of the DNA findings given alleged transfer scenarios in the current state of knowledge?Regarding the first, my view is that it is definitely the role of the forensic scientist to provide as much guidance to the trier of facts if the knowledge he/she may bring is outside the general knowledge of the court and relevant to the task at hand. Shying away from this duty on the ground that considerations regarding transfer of trace DNA is less known than source level DNA statistics is not acceptable. There is a risk with leaving the presence of DNA to be assessed by others, left to advocacy, when the scientist can bring decisive knowledge (let alone the papers reviewed by Meakin and Jamieson), including highlighting how complex the task may be. We want to avoid the simplistic line of argument that I have heard at times: “We have found DNA corresponding to the defendant on the trigger of firearm, hence he manipulated the gun”. It is crucial for a fair administration of justice that forensic scientists weigh their expectations of the amount of DNA recovered given both views. Hence scientists’ guidance is required when the consideration of transfer mechanisms, persistence and background levels of the material has a significant impact on the understanding of the alleged activities and requires expert knowledge. But to provide guidance, the scientist will need information regarding the alleged case circumstances from both prosecution and defence’s perspective. The duty may also require the scientist to highlight how little is known on transfer mechanisms and urge for a very careful assessment of the evidential contribution of the forensic findings, regardless of their strength with regards to the issue of the source itself. The absence of knowledge should not be an excuse for a guilty silence and for delegating the task to the fact finder without making explicit the complexity surrounding such an assessment.In relation to the second question, Risinger (2013) warns against the “abuse of the notion of subjective probability”, … “by simply making their best guess from experience when more should be required”. In contrast, courts (I will concentrate here on the jurisdiction of England and Wales) have recently given a lot of freedom or authority to DNA scientists to exercise their professional judgement even when limited or no published data were available. In R v Reed and Reed, the court ruled that in the context of the analysis of minute quantity of DNA, a reporting scientist is fully entitled to assess and weigh the relative merits of the possible mechanisms whereby cellular material can be exchanged. In that case the forensic scientist testified that, in her experience, it was highly unlikely that the appellants had innocently touched the knives and it was unrealistic that each appellant had passed their DNA to someone else who then transferred it to the pieces of plastic which were found at the victim’s address. The court while recognizing that the scientific knowledge on transferability was incomplete, ruled that enough reliability had been demonstrated when the scientist is asked to consider cases where more than 200 picograms of DNA had been recovered. The court however stressed that “care must be taken to guard against the dangers of that evaluation being tainted with the verisimilitude of scientific certainty”. The scientist is then authorised to comment on the probability of the forensic results given various transfer mechanisms as long as he/she makes it clear that we are dealing here with large uncertainty. This judgement led to a few commentaries. Jamieson (2011) highlighted the limited body of evidence represented by the few papers quoted by the court to support their opinion and warned against the view that the personal experience might override scientific research. A worry echoed in an editorial (Nic Da\&\#233;id, 2010) in Science and Justice following the next case against Weller.In R v Weller (a case involving the transfer of a reasonable quantity of DNA under the fingernails of the defendant), the defence appealed on the ground that knowledge regarding transfer and persistence mechanisms of DNA was not sufficient for experts to have been able to express an evaluation of the relative merit of the alleged activities. The Court of Appeal confirmed the positions taken in Reed and Reed. Given the difficulties of conducting systematically experiments replicating the circumstances in a particular case, the court recognized that a scientist is fully entitled to express a professional opinion on his/her expectation of DNA quantities given each mechanism envisaged by the court if the scientist has sufficient casework day-to-day experience. Jamieson and Meakin (2010) expressed their concerns after Weller seeing courts in England and Wales putting more trust in claimed experience than in published, peer-reviewed, publications. Rudin and Inman (2010a) also insisted on the fact that bald experience is not an acceptable substitute for experimental data.Following these two cases, the Court of Appeal confirmed that view in subsequent rulings, not only in relation to consideration of DNA transfer but also of the sources of complex DNA mixtures. In R v Thomas, a DNA scientist invoked her 12 years experience (and some unpublished and undisclosed data) to suggest that in a three-person DNA mixture, there was a low expectation of finding components matching all those of the appellant adventitiously. In R v Dlugosz, Pickering and MDS, the court, recognizing their extensive professional experience, allowed two DNA scientists to qualify the occurrence of alleles in a complex mixture corresponding to the defendant as a “rare” for one and “somewhat unusual” for the other. The qualitative opinion expressed by the scientists was offered as an acceptable substitute in cases where the mixture is too complex for a quantitative assessment. However, as pointed out by Evett and Pope (2013), “there is no scientific basis for this belief – no scientific literature provides a reliable methodology, scientists are not trained to make such assessments and there is no body of standards to support them. Casework experience is not a substitute.” One needs to assess the robustness of such qualitative opinion through a structured program of proficiency tests: it should not be based on casework data, but on DNA mixtures obtained under controlled conditions. Expressing qualitative judgments on the basis (or assumptions) of casework samples, without any calibration mechanism, is dangerous in my view. The expressed opinion could be the expression of nothing more than the ipse dixit of the expert.The Court of Appeal endorsed such a laissez faire approach drawing from a much larger jurisprudence applicable to expertise in general, with some decisions relating to other areas of forensic disciplines. For example, in R v Otway, involving gait analysis, and two other cases, namely R v Atkins and Atkins (face recognition) and R v T (footwear mark), the court recognized that an expert may express a qualitative opinion in the absence of quantitative (or statistical) supporting data as long as the subjective nature of the opinion and its foundation are transparently presented without giving more scientific weight to the judgment than it disserves. Edmond (2010) remains rightly sceptical with the approach of dressing an opinion with all the concessions of limitations, but still allowing it, when the real significance of the forensic findings remains simply unknown. In my view, what is critical, when it comes to offer expert opinions (in the present discussion regarding DNA transfer), is striking the appropriate balance between structured documented data (published or not) and unfettered personal opinion. Should these opinions be based in extenso on experience? My answer is clearly negative. I believe that experience constitutes a poor substitute to a systematic and structured acquisition of data. Any scientist offering views as to his/her expectations for the forensic findings under given case-related circumstances should be able to put forward documented sets of controlled experiments whose relevancy to the case under dispute can be argued. A further question is how many controlled experiments should be conducted and how close should they be to the alleged circumstances. In my view that question should be approached on a case-by-case basis using the adversarial mechanisms available to the parties. The major improvement here is that all parties can access and challenge the body of knowledge available to the expert proffering an opinion. As Rudin and Inman (2010a) indicated, the problem with experience only based opinions is that it cannot be challenged beyond the sterile opposition between mere opinions. Requiring the disclosure of structured data opens the route to a new type of debate regarding the relative merits of the assessments provided.We could legitimately ask, as did Rudin and Inman (2010b), whether or not forensic science has gone too far in terms of sensitivity, meaning that the risks associated with the analysis of irrelevant (meaning not associated with the criminal activities under investigation) items are too high. I believe that the problem lies more in the usage made by law enforcement authorities of such sensitive technologies. There are only gains in terms of investigative leads if we take advantage of sensitive techniques, but maybe these methods should be used only in the investigative phase, not as a basis for evidence relied on at trial. Highly sensitive DNA analysis offers extraordinary ways to enhance an investigation through the suggestion of potential named sources (through DNA databases) for the inquiry to consider. I am not calling for limiting such opportunities. However, moving from such investigative information towards elements of evidentiary purposes to be used in court requires very careful attention. It may well be the case that a decisive investigative information will not be brought to court because of the issues discussed above. This is not a failure of forensic science, but simply an appropriate and fair (re-)positioning of the scientific techniques within the criminal justice process.},

	abstract = {We seek to develop a rational approach to forming propositions when little information is available from the outset, as this often happens in casework. If propositions used when evaluating evidence are not exhaustive (in the context of the case), then there is a theoretical risk that an LR greater than one may be associated with a proposition in the numerator that - if all meaningful propositions had been considered - would in fact have a lower posterior probability after consideration of the evidence. Ideally, all propositions should be considered. However, with multiple propositions, some terms will be larger than others and for simplification very small terms can be neglected without changing the order of magnitude of the value of the evidence (i.e. LR). Our analysis shows that mathematically a contributor’s DNA can be assumed to be present under both prosecution and alternative propositions (Hp and Ha) if there is a reasonable prior probability of their DNA being present and their inclusion is supported by the profile. This is because the terms associated to these sub-propositions will dominate our LR. For example, in the absence of specific information, when considering two persons of interest (POI) as potential contributors to a mixed DNA profile we suggest the assumption of one when examining the presence of the other, after checking that both collectively explain the profile well. This represents more meaningful propositions and allows better discrimination. Slooten and Caliebe have shown that the overall LR is the weighted average of LRs with the same number of contributors (NoC) under both propositions. The weights involve both an assessment of the probability of the crime scene DNA profile and the probability of this NoC given the background information.},

This theme reflects the fact that forensic science is evolving rapidly, not only within individual sub-disciplines but, critically, across the whole forensic science landscape. Identifying and predicting evolutionary change will enable a more focused and constructive future for forensic science. The IAFS meeting originally scheduled for 2020 was cancelled due to the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, on 18 May 2021, an IAFS Virtual Event launched the Sydney Declaration as an integral part of the WTFH initiative. The Sydney Declaration articulates a definition and seven principles for forensic science and provides a much-needed platform for forensic science into the future. It is aspirational, not focused on organisations, techniques or protocols, and provides a shared understanding of forensic science and its principles. The 2023 IAFS meeting built on the Sydney Declaration, with five themes developed as the basis for eliciting information from delegates related to the WTFH concept. The themes were: (i) integration and harmonisation; (ii) digital transformation; (iii) research; (iv) education and training; and (v) technology. Information across these themes was gathered via short, sharply focused panel discussions in the final session of each of the 22 disciplines represented at the meeting. In addition, there was a panel-based seminar on the Sydney Declaration and a panel-based plenary session on the conference theme. Meeting delegates were also able to provide their thoughts during the meeting, and for a two-week post-conference window, via a dedicated meeting app. Information from all of these sources has been collated to provide a consolidated WTFH landscape for forensic science.},

It finds that several of the common forensic disciplines in the criminal justice system in New Zealand have been the subject of critique and criticism internationally, the most common source of expert evidence was presented by the prosecution and provided by institutional police laboratories, and in most cases the forensic expert testified either to the uniqueness assumption or to an individualised match determination. It concludes that the New Zealand Parliament should amend the Evidence Act 2006 to require a demonstration of foundational validity and as-applied reliability as a precondition to the admissibility of any purported scientific evidence.},

Some of the variation was due to different decisions that would be made on a case-by-case basis, some due to laboratory policy and would hence differ between laboratories, and the final and smallest part was the run-to-run difference caused by the Monte Carlo aspect of the software used. However, the net variation in LRs was considerable. We believe that most laboratories will self-diagnose the cause of their difference from the majority answer and in some, but not all instances will take corrective action. An inter-laboratory exercise consisting of raw data files for relatively straightforward mixtures, such as two mixtures of three or four persons, would allow laboratories to calibrate their procedures and findings.},

Consequently, the forensic community has been left with no clear path to navigate these concerns as each proposed approach has countervailing benefits and risks. To explore these issues further and provide a foundation for a path forward, this study draws on semi-structured interviews with fifteen participants to elicit the perspectives of key criminal justice stakeholders, including laboratory managers, prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, and other academic scholars, on issues related to interpretation and reporting practices and the use of computational algorithms in forensic science within the American legal system.},

	abstract = {There is a continuous flow of articles published in legal and scientific journals that recite outworn direct or subtle attacks on Bayesian reasoning and/or the use of the subjective or personalistic interpretation of probability. An example is the recent paper written by Kaplan et al. (2016), who, by referring to Kafadar’s review paper (2015), opined, but did not justify, that there is a ‘… need to reduce subjectivity in the evaluation of forensic science’ and argued that ‘… the view presented here supports the use of objective probabilities’ (Kaplan et al., 2016). To understand why the objection on the use of subjective probability is not persuasive and why the widely claimed objective probabilities do not exist, one must first scrutinize the historically competing interpretations of probability and their associated definitions. The basis of the defence of the use of the subjectivist interpretation of probability is the understanding of the simple points, misunderstood by critics, that subjectivity is not a synonym for arbitrariness and that the implementation of subjectivism does not neglect the use of the acquired knowledge that is often available in terms of relative frequencies. We will illustrate these points by reference to practical applications in forensic science where probabilities are often represented by relative frequencies. In this regard, our discussion clarifies the connection and the distinction between probabilities and frequencies. Specifically, we emphasize that probability is an expression of our personal belief, an interpretation not to be equated with relative frequency as a mere summary of data. Our argument reveals the inappropriateness of attempts to interpret relative frequencies as probabilities, and naturally solves common problems that derive from such attempts. Further we emphasize that, despite the fact that they can be given an explicit role in probability assignments, neither are relative frequencies a necessary condition for such assignments nor, in forensic applications that consider events for which probabilities need to be specified, need they be meaningfully conceptualized in a frequentist perspective.},

Six such fallacies are presented: it is an ethical issue, only applies to “bad apples”, experts are impartial and immune, technology eliminates bias, blind spot, and the illusion of control. Then, eight sources of bias are discussed and conceptualized within three categories: (A) factors that relate to the specific case and analysis, which include the data, reference materials, and contextual information, (B) factors that relate to the specific person doing the analysis, which include past experience base rates, organizational factors, education and training, and personal factors, and lastly, (C) cognitive architecture and human nature that impacts all of us. These factors can impact what the data are (e.g., how data are sampled and collected, or what is considered as noise and therefore disregarded), the actual results (e.g., decisions on testing strategies, how analysis is conducted, and when to stop testing), and the conclusions (e.g., interpretation of the results). The paper concludes with specific measures that can minimize these biases.},

	abstract = {The use of Munsell colour charts is the classical way of determining colour information in soil science. The procedure is well-known and consists of visually comparing soil samples with colour chips contained in the charts. This visual approach has several drawbacks and although the chart-based procedure is routinely used, it is not easy to find systematic studies on the accuracy of this methodology. In this paper, we seek to gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of using soil colour charts as a colour measurement device. The tool used to conduct our study is a modification to the attribute agreement analysis (AAA) method which consists of finding matches between colour standards and colour designations obtained by several appraisers. In the experiment, standards were obtained using a trichromatic colorimeter coupled to a computer program that implements the k nearest neighbour (k-NN) classification algorithm. In order to do the experiment, 276 soil samples were observed twice by four trained appraisers (2208 data records). The naïve count of matches across all the records in the dataset gave {\textless}5\% of agreement for all three colour components Hue, Value and Chroma. The modified AAA criterion implemented in the study gave a clear increase in all indicators with values ranging from 82.2\% to 100\% in the agreement within appraisers, 39.5\% in the agreement between appraisers, and 42.8\% in the agreement of appraisers vs. standards. Results also show that users of the Munsell charts tend to mostly report correct Hues but higher Values and Chromas than true soil colours.},

Likelihood that targets will be missed varies with target prevalence, the frequency with which targets are presented across trials. Miss error rates are much higher at low target prevalence (1\%-2\%) than at high prevalence (50\%). Unfortunately, low prevalence is characteristic of important search tasks such as airport security and medical screening where miss errors are dangerous. A series of experiments show this prevalence effect is very robust. In signal detection terms, the prevalence effect can be explained as a criterion shift and not a change in sensitivity. Several efforts to induce observers to adopt a better criterion fail. However, a regime of brief retraining periods with high prevalence and full feedback allows observers to hold a good criterion during periods of low prevalence with no feedback.

This forms the groundwork for exposing many sources of confusion in the PCAST report. We explain how the notion of treating the scientist as a black box and the assignment of evidential weight through error rates is overly restrictive and misconceived.

	abstract = {Forensic DNA Trace Evidence Interpretation: Activity Level Propositions and Likelihood Ratios provides all foundational information required for a reader to understand the practice of evaluating forensic biology evidence given activity level propositions and to implement the practice into active casework within a forensic institution. The book begins by explaining basic concepts and foundational theory, pulling together research and studies that have accumulated in forensic journal literature over the last 20 years. The book explains the laws of probability - showing how they can be used to derive, from first principles, the likelihood ratio - used throughout the book to express the strength of evidence for any evaluation. Concepts such as the hierarchy of propositions, the difference between experts working in an investigative or evaluative mode and the practice of case assessment and interpretation are explained to provide the reader with a broad grounding in the topics that are important to understanding evaluation of evidence. Activity level evaluations are discussed in relation to biological material transferred from one object to another, the ability for biological material to persist on an item for a period of time or through an event, the ability to recover the biological material from the object when sampled for forensic testing and the expectations of the prevalence of biological material on objects in our environment. These concepts of transfer, persistence, prevalence and recovery are discussed in detail in addition to the factors that affect each of them.The authors go on to explain the evaluation process: how to structure case information and formulate propositions. This includes how a likelihood ratio formula can be derived to evaluate the forensic findings, introducing Bayesian networks and explaining what they represent and how they can be used in evaluations and showing how evaluation can be tested for robustness. Using these tools, the authors also demonstrate the ways that the methods used in activity level evaluations are applied to questions about body fluids. There are also chapters dedicated to reporting of results and implementation of activity level evaluation in a working forensic laboratory. Throughout the book, four cases are used as examples to demonstrate how to relate the theory to practice and detail how laboratories can integrate and implement activity level evaluation into their active casework.},

Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is associated with systemic inflammation, and recent research indicates that cfDNA is an inflammatory marker that is sensitive to psychological stress in humans. The present study investigated the effects of acute stress on the kinetics of cfDNA in a within-subjects design. Twenty-nine males (mean age: 24.34 ± 4.08 years) underwent both the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a resting condition. Blood samples were collected at two time points before and at 9 time points up to 105 min after both conditions. The cfDNA immediately increased 2-fold after the TSST and returned to baseline levels after 30 min after the test, showing that a brief psychological stressor was sufficient to evoke a robust and rapid increase in cfDNA levels. No associations were detected between perceived stress, whereas subjects with higher basal cfDNA levels showed higher increases. The rapid cfDNA regulation might be attributed to the transient activation of immune cells caused by neuroendocrine-immune activation. Further research is required to evaluate the reliability of cfDNA as a marker of neuroendocrine-immune activation, which could be used for diagnostics purposes or monitoring of treatment progression.},

The survey was approved by the IRB and emailed to forensic laboratory directors, assistant directors, and/or DNA technical leaders and responses were submitted by them or their designees. Over thirty leaders and stakeholders responded. In this article, we report on the results of the survey. Respondents indicated that training activities included readings, writing assignments and quizzes, shadowing analysts, and mock casework and that training is documented and is a collaborative effort of the technical leader, unit supervisor, advanced forensic scientists, and other analysts and technicians. Laboratories assess competency using multiple methods including performance on mock casework, report writing, laboratory practical and competency tests, and a mock trial and testimony. The top three training activities reported are hands-on practice, shadowing, and readings. The top three focuses of the training are laboratory techniques (extraction, quantitation, amplification, and capillary electrophoresis), STR typing, and mixture analysis. Ethics violations and failure to pass the competency tests and mock trial, even after remediation, are the top reasons new hires fail training. Finally, the top items respondents would like to spend more time offering training on are troubleshooting, validation, and root cause analysis.},

Due to a lack of standardization, knowledge and training, these questions are often addressed poorly or inadequately, thus, potentially adversely impacting justice outcomes. As the forensic community moves towards contemplating activity-level assessments, it becomes incumbent on the expert to be well equipped to do so. The likelihood of alternative scenarios must be provided using data and methodologies that are valid both foundationally and as applied. The expert must be aware of the current knowledge of variables potentially impacting any assessment, including those involving DNA-TPPR, and the associated limitations. We have conducted preliminary assessments of DNA reporting scientists on their general understanding of DNA-TPPR and ability to identify key factors that could impact transfer probabilities. Differences were observed between individuals, from between and within laboratories, in their level of comprehension of DNA-TPPR. Apart from the need for further studies to validate the variables impacting DNA-TPPR and the extent of their impact in different situations, we advocate that individuals utilizing this information should be specifically authorized to conduct such analyses and provide expert opinion in criminal investigations and legal proceedings relating to DNA-TPPR. Furthermore, improvements are required in the foundational and ongoing training of these individuals. The setting of standards to be met by such training, how to test competency, and the availability of regular purpose-fit proficiency tests, requires urgent attention.},

This can provide useful information when the alleged activity involves the presence of various bodily fluids such as blood, semen, and/or saliva, as well as skin contact made between a perpetrator and a victim. Optimal recovery techniques for the collection of DNA evidence, following crime-relevant skin contact, can be dependent on the surface being sampled. Additional factors to consider include the body areas typically contacted during various activities and the likelihood of non-self-DNA being present in those areas prior to contacts of interest. Therefore, an understanding of DNA transfer, prevalence, persistence, and recovery on a body can aid in the interpretation of DNA results given activity-level questions and increase the value of the findings from this type of evidence. This review aims to summarise research on DNA-TPPR concerning various human body surfaces following different types of activities. This review examines the prevalence of background DNA on different skin surfaces, the reported DNA transfer associated with different forms of contact, and how different cofounding factors can affect the persistence of DNA.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}When forensic scientists evaluate and report on the probative strength of single DNA traces, they commonly rely on only one number, expressing the rarity of the DNA profile in the population of interest. This is so because the focus is on propositions regarding the source of the recovered trace material, such as “the person of interest is the source of the crime stain.” In particular, when the alternative proposition is “an unknown person is the source of the crime stain,” one is directed to think about the rarity of the profile. However, in the era of DNA profiling technology capable of producing results from small quantities of trace material (i.e., non-visible staining) that is subject to easy and ubiquitous modes of transfer, the issue of source is becoming less central, to the point that it is often not contested. There is now a shift from the question “whose DNA is this?” to the question “how did it get there?” As a consequence, recipients of expert information are now very much in need of assistance with the evaluation of the meaning and probative strength of DNA profiling results when the competing propositions of interest refer to different activities. This need is widely demonstrated in day-to-day forensic practice and is also voiced in specialized literature. Yet many forensic scientists remain reluctant to assess their results given propositions that relate to different activities. Some scientists consider evaluations beyond the issue of source as being overly speculative, because of the lack of relevant data and knowledge regarding phenomena and mechanisms of transfer, persistence and background of DNA. Similarly, encouragements to deal with these activity issues, expressed in a recently released European guideline on evaluative reporting (Willis et al., {\textless}xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43"{\textgreater}2015{\textless}/xref{\textgreater}), which highlights the need for rethinking current practice, are sometimes viewed skeptically or are not considered feasible. In this discussion paper, we select and discuss recurrent skeptical views brought to our attention, as well as some of the alternative solutions that have been suggested. We will argue that the way forward is to address now, rather than later, the challenges associated with the evaluation of DNA results (from small quantities of trace material) in light of different activities to prevent them being misrepresented in court.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {IntroductionThe proposal of a discussion about the use of software to help assign likelihood ratios for forensic DNA profiling results, and the use of their output in the legal process, is both timely and important (see also related contributions elsewhere in Frontiers, e.g., Biedermann et al., 2014). Ever since their introduction in forensic science, DNA profiling analyses have been accompanied with the results of calculations of various sorts. Their scope is well illustrated and documented in several reference monographs (e.g., Balding and Steele, 2015; Buckleton et al., 2005; Evett and Weir, 1998). This solid body of scholarly research and established practice has contributed to the widely held view among scientists and recipients of expert information that eliciting the probative strength of forensic DNA profiling results is per se a numerical task. In this commentary, we intend – in a first part – to make the point that although calculations are, by virtue, an integral part of the quantification of probative strength, it is equally important at the outset to be clear about the question “Why are we doing a calculation?” (Buckleton et al., 2005, at p. 151). We will argue that this is not a question that statistics can answer. Stated otherwise, we will contend that, as much it is important to be clear in any instance about what a particular computation exactly purports to do, it is essential to define the questions that are of interest in a particular case at hand. In a second part, we will emphasize on the extent to which, why and how a recently issued guidelines (e.g., ENFSI, 2015) encourage such thinking about cases prior to conducting calculations, if any.Questioning default calculationsExperience demonstrates that many scientists working in operational laboratories decide on the use of particular computational procedures [Footnote: The scope of these procedures is large and includes topics such as complex modelling of products (e.g., stutters) of the PCR amplification of STRs (e.g., Bright et al., 2014; Gittelson et al., 2014) and the study of the sensitivity of expressions of probative value due to the use of particular statistical techniques (e.g., MCMC techniques, see for example Bright et al., 2015).] – often provided by ready-to-use software packages – based on the mere availability of those procedures at their workplace. This amounts to a convenience choice, but what is more is that proceeding in this way is considered the best one could do. This view may be reinforced if the software is based on Bayesian principles, because procedures that belong to this class of inferential methods are referred to as the most inferentially sound. But the sole fact that a procedure relies on Bayesian principles does not make it per se pertinent for the case at hand. As noted by Lindley (2004, p. 74), “[t]he main danger is that they [Bayesian methods; added by the authors] will be used automatically. (…) You must think about the real quantities involved, like temperature or blood pressure, and not about symbols that represent them. This distinction between the thinking you and the unthinking, calculating personal computer is essential.” This danger also exists in the context of interpreting and reporting forensic DNA results. Indeed, most of the commonly available computational procedures lead to expressions of probative strength to help discriminate between so-called sub-source level propositions (e.g., ‘the person of interest (POI) is the source of the recovered DNA’ versus ‘an unknown person is the source of the recovered DNA’). But, in many practical cases, the real question goes beyond this level, e.g. how the detected DNA got where it was found (Evett et al., 2002; Taroni et al., 2013), that is so-called activity level propositions. Cases of alleged rape where the competing versions only differ with respect to the activities that led to the trace illustrate this. This is of course not a critique of models being Bayesian in nature, but of the kind of questions to which some of these models are tailored.Sceptics may invoke that none of the above problems are novel. But why then practice by and large remains unchanged? While some scientists openly acknowledge that expressions of probative strength of DNA considering sub-source level propositions may indeed be insufficient for the needs, some hold that it is for the Court to decide on that matter. We perfectly agree with this stance, of course, because whatever the level of the propositions, it is for the Court to decide on the probability of the propositions. Notwithstanding, scientists can add considerable value by assessing their results given activity level propositions. Yet others contend that one can leave this debate until the Courtroom. However, this may raise issues from a quality management point of view, and render the situation very uncomfortable for the witness, because of the inevitable difficulty of the task. The challenge is real for a variety of case scenarios, in particular where only low quantities of DNA are detected and/or when POIs do not deny that the recovered DNA is theirs. We seriously doubt that members of the judiciary are able to properly appreciate the extent to which one can expect to obtain a low quantity of DNA, recovered at a certain position on the crime scene, the victim or a POI, given one activity as compared to another activity. We would not recommend either doing this evaluation on the stand. This is because such assessments are very challenging even for experts, and require scientific knowledge about many factors, such as transfer, persistence and the capacity of a given donor to shed detectable quantities of DNA.[footnote: On this topic, see for example http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/9115916/The-case-against-DNA.html.] Let us emphasise again that the question of whether the detected DNA is that of the POI may be entirely uncontested (and thus there would be no need for a likelihood ratio given sub-source propositions as there is no uncertainty about sub-source). What is really of interest is to assess the probability of observing such a result for a DNA trace, that is a trace found in a particular position, in a given quantity and leading to a profile of the observed quality given the alleged activities and given relevant information such as the time lapse between collection of trace material and the commission of the crime, environmental factors to which the trace was exposed (e.g., temperature, humidity) etc. Such assessments are highly case dependent, which calls for the generation of more research with experiments under controlled conditions, that can help build a community-wide knowledge base (Evett, 2015).[footnote: For an example in other transfer traces, see Buckleton et al. (1989).] To further emphasize the need for considering observations given activity level propositions, note again that the result which is to be assessed is not only the rarity of genetic features, but also extends to the very fact of finding, at a given position, a detectable quantity of DNA (Evett and Weir, 1998), which may be nil. Sub-source level propositions cannot deal with results that did not yield a DNA profile.The mismatch between default evaluations given sub-source level propositions and the decision makers’ interest in activity level propositions is a cause of concern because the strength of the observations in the former case can be radically different from that of the latter, so that inappropriate conclusions can result if the two are taken to be equivalent. We have seen this happen in cases where scientists report likelihood ratios in the order of \&gt;1020 with propositions at sub-source level when in fact the real issue was one of activities and where the strength of the findings, given the conditioning information of the case at hand, was way more moderate.[footnote: Another issue, not pursued here, is whether likelihood ratios exceeding one over the earth population, and multiples of that, are reasonable. There is much argument to say they are not (e.g., Hopwood et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2003).] Current recommendationsThe above discussion is not intended to suggest that evaluation given (sub)-source level propositions is useless or detrimental in principle.[footnote: In fact, the strength of the DNA correspondence is so high that this will lead to situations where the source of the DNA will be admitted (leaving no uncertainty on the source of the DNA). This, then moves the issue to the activities.] The point we seek to make is that it is crucial to assess the needs of the recipient of expert information prior to choosing a computational procedure. This seems like an obvious and moderate requirement, yet experience shows that often it is given little attention in practice. Recent works by forensic scientists from across Europe, published in the form of a guideline (ENFSI, 2015), seek both to strengthen awareness of this issue and help scientists and recipients of expert information proceed in a more sensible way. For example, in its Guidance Note 2 on propositions, the document specifies: “Source level propositions are adequate in cases where there is no risk that the court will misinterpret them in the context of the alleged activities in the case” (ENFSI, 2015, p. 12). To illustrate this idea, the following example is given: “A large fresh bloodstain is recovered at the point of entry at a burglary scene and delivered to the laboratory for DNA analysis. Combination of a presumptive test and appearance allows the scientist to safely assume that the stain is blood. A suspect says that he has never been in the premises. The set of propositions can be (1) the bloodstain came from the defendant and (2) the bloodstain came from another unknown individual” (ENFSI, 2015, p. 12). In this example, source level propositions are not problematic because no expert knowledge is required regarding phenomena such as transfer and persistence, as well as background levels of DNA. Such factors do not impact, in this kind of circumstances, on the understanding of scientific findings relative to the alleged activities. In particular, it is not doubted that the bloodstain results from the act of breaking in. This example also illustrates that there is more to the collected trace than the DNA profile: there are aspects such as the freshness of the stain, the quantity of material and the position where the trace was found. In turn, it is clear that specialised knowledge regarding transfer, persistence and background would matter in the above scenario if DNA had been detected in low quantities, rather than from a rich bloodstain. The above understanding has far reaching implications: the level of propositions depends on the factors and observations on which forensic scientists have expert knowledge. It is their duty to evaluate all their results so that the Court is not deprived of information that is necessary for a balanced view. For example, the ENFSI guideline explicitly advises against the changing of propositions from activity to (sub-) source level when relevant expert knowledge is not available: “In fact, the choice between (sub-) source and activity should not be influenced by the availability of data or expert knowledge but solely from the consideration of factors such as transfer, persistence and background levels that could crucially affect the strength of the findings within the context of the case circumstances.”\&\#160; (ENFSI, 2015, p. 13)We acknowledge, from personal experience, that the implementation of the above perspective is challenging. It may be even more so in systems exposed to commercialisation where forensic providers that conduct DNA profiling analyses operate more and more separated from those entities that collected trace material at the crime scene (Jackson, 2013). Further obstacles may be operational constraints such as time and costs, because evaluation given activity level propositions does not rely on default computations, but generally requires a case-based approach. Regarding the latter point, some scientists deplore a lack of formulaic developments for evaluation given propositions at higher hierarchical levels. But this critique does fall short of the current state of developments. Formal likelihood ratio approaches exist (e.g., Evett, 1984; Evett and Weir, 1998), used also for other transfer materials (e.g., glass; Curran et al., 2001), and there are reports that demonstrate the relevance and practical feasibility (e.g., McKenna, 2013). Yet other developments allow one to account for uncertainty about the relevance of the recovered material and the possibility that material was left for innocent reasons (e.g., Evett, 1993; Evett et al., 2002).The role of statistics in evaluating DNA profiling evidence has always been important, but we now must realise that, increasingly often, the traditional perspective of sub-source level propositions, and the main focus on the rarity of the corresponding features (i.e., the so-called conditional genotype probability), may represent only a first step of the evaluative process. This does not make these evaluation approaches wrong, only less comprehensive. The fact is that the extrinsic characteristics of the trace material (i.e., low quantities of DNA) and the propositions of interest have changed, and it is important to realise that this represents the relevant starting point. This recognition of the needs cannot be answered by statistics, only the evaluative procedures that need to be built once the needs are properly elicited. The importance of statistics in this endeavour remains unaffected, and stands as noted by Lindley (2000, p. 38): “(…) the first task of a statistician is to develop a (probability) model to embrace the client’s interest’s and uncertainties. It will include the data and any parameters that are judged necessary. Once accomplished, the mechanics of the calculus take over and the required inference is made.”},

When Auguste Comte coined the phrase sociology, he had in mind the objective study of human behavior according to rational principles. A pertinent example of objective sociological analysis is that of Émile Durkheim, who argued that sociologists should analyze the internal (and impersonal) causes of social phenomena through the observation of concrete facts. Another notable example is, of course, the scholarship of Karl Marx, who also believed in a form of social scientism that went beyond the surface of social life through the analysis of concrete social facts. Durkheim distinguished this analysis from philosophical introspection and generalizations that would be unduly affected by subjective influences such as beliefs and values (Giddens 1993; Crow 2005).},

Much of the time this communication is limited to written opinions in expert reports. Notwithstanding considerable scientific research and debate about the best way to communicate forensic science opinions, it is unclear how much of the advice has translated into forensic science practice. In conducting this descriptive study, we examined the reporting practices adopted by forensic scientists across a range of forensic science disciplines. Specifically, we used a quantitative content analysis approach to identify the conclusion types and additional information submitted by forensic scientists in proficiency tests during 2016 (“What would be the wording of the Conclusions in your report?”). Our analysis of 500 randomly selected responses in eight disciplines indicated that the conclusion type which has received the most criticism in recent years (categorical statements) remains the preferred means of expression in a clear majority of responses. We also found that the provision of additional information often considered necessary for rational evaluation of the evidence (e.g., information about reliability and validity) was rarely reported. These results suggest limited engagement with recent recommendations and are concerning given the gravity of the legal decisions that hinge on accurate and transparent forensic science communication.},

	abstract = {Forensic science continues to be openly challenged and criticized. The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of forensic workplaces and the perceived current and potential future issues from forensic scientists via a detailed survey. An online survey was designed and disseminated to forensic practitioners and researchers worldwide. 544 participants from more than 20 countries took part in the survey. Participants personally rated ten forensic disciplines with subjective methodologies, responded on a five-point Likert scale to 22 statements that addressed subjectivity and objectivity, validation and proficiency testing and error and bias and answered demographic questions relating to their workplace type, level of experience and qualifications. Participants also commented freely on forensic issues specifically important to them. The purpose of this paper is to provide the survey results and consensuses captured on several key issues. Overall participants believed forensic science must be valid and reliable and supported development of objective methodologies, validation and further investigation into the application statistics, use of error rates and implications of cognitive bias. Participants raised consensus concerns with the provision of expert evidence and other broader issues. This information and understanding from the forensic front line are essential for forensic science moving forward to best address current challenges and criticisms not only of forensic evidence for the court but for applications of forensic science beyond the courtroom.},

	abstract = {Forensic science has been at the crossroads for over a decade. While this situation is a fertile ground for discussion, security problem solving and the sound administration of justice cannot be put on hold until solutions pleasing everyone emerge. In all practical reality, forensic science will continue to be applied because it is simply the most reliable way to reconstruct the past through the exploitation of relics of criminal activities and by logical treatment of the collected information. In this paper, it is argued that instead of exclusively focusing on error management and processes, we should also question the very ontological nature of forensic science. Not only should the dominant conception of forensic sciences as a patchwork of disciplines assisting the criminal justice system be challenged, but forensic science’s own fundamental principles should also be better enunciated and promoted so they can be more broadly accepted and understood. Such changes invite operations, education and research to become more collective and interdisciplinary. This is necessary to fully exploit the investigative, epidemiological, court and social functions of forensic science. We ought to ask the question: will forensic science reach the end of the crossroads soon?},

It identifies areas for improvement in quality practices and services. The issues surrounding error, i.e., measurement error, human error, contextual bias, and confirmatory bias, and interpretation are discussed. Infrastructure is already in place to support reliability. However, more definition and clarity of terms and interpretation would facilitate communication and understanding. Material improvement across the disciplines should be sought through national programs in education and training, focused on science, the scientific method, statistics, and ethics. To provide direction for advancing the forensic sciences a list of recommendations ranging from further documentation to new research and validation to education and to accreditation is provided for consideration. The list is a starting point for discussion that could foster further thought and input in developing an overarching strategic plan for enhancing the forensic sciences.},

	abstract = {The forensic examiner's role is to assist the court by explaining the significance of their findings within the context of the case. In “evaluative” reporting this is achieved by considering the probability of observing the evidence given at least two competing propositions. This article outlines the requirements of propositions within an evaluative framework, common sets of propositions used in handwriting examinations and their associated basic expectations. As the forensic handwriting examiner may be asked to undertake different types of comparisons depending on the material available and the case circumstances, it is critical that examiners carefully consider the most appropriate propositions against which the findings are to be evaluated. Further, as the propositions are derived from case information, and may require assumptions to be drawn, the necessary disclosure within reports is discussed. Although the examples given are specific to handwriting examinations, the concepts discussed in this article are applicable to other forensic disciplines utilizing an evaluative approach to evidence interpretation.

	abstract = {Forensic and medical examiners are often required to sample the body of a victim (either living or deceased), or a suspect of a criminal offence, for foreign DNA. This can provide useful information when the alleged activity involves the presence of various bodily fluids such as blood, semen, and/or saliva, as well as skin contact made between a perpetrator and a victim. Optimal recovery techniques for the collection of DNA evidence, following crime-relevant skin contact, can be dependent on the surface being sampled. Additional factors to consider include the body areas typically contacted during various activities and the likelihood of non-self-DNA being present in those areas prior to contacts of interest. Therefore, an understanding of DNA transfer, prevalence, persistence, and recovery on a body can aid in the interpretation of DNA results given activity-level questions and increase the value of the findings from this type of evidence. This review aims to summarise research on DNA-TPPR concerning various human body surfaces following different types of activities. This review examines the prevalence of background DNA on different skin surfaces, the reported DNA transfer associated with different forms of contact, and how different cofounding factors can affect the persistence of DNA.},

Most DNA transfer studies have focused on one-way transfer, neglecting bi-directional exchange. This study examines two-way transfer of blood and touch DNA between plastic and cotton substrates under passive and friction conditions, using methods from previous unidirectional transfer experiments. Our investigation established statistically significant correlations between bi-directional DNA transfer rates and manner of contact but not substrate type and type of biological material. While, in general, no significant differences were noted between bi-directional and unidirectional transfer rates, significant differences were observed for certain variable combinations where unidirectional transfer resulted in higher transfer rates. This research provides baseline data on bi-directional DNA transfer under semi-controlled conditions, complementing existing unidirectional transfer knowledge. Understanding bi-directional transfer is crucial for accurately modelling DNA transfer events in forensic scenarios, especially for activity level evaluations.},

	abstract = {Judicial decision-making in continental law systems requires carefully evaluating complex, interdependent evidence while ensuring consistency and fairness. This study investigates the application of Bayesian networks in structuring legal evidence within an AI-based decision support system. The primary research objective is to assess the enhancement of transparency, minimization of cognitive overload, and reduced bias in judicial processes through probabilistic reasoning. The proposed system dynamically updates outcome probabilities as new evidence is introduced, enabling real-time monitoring of case likelihoods. AI-generated recommendations are aligned with judicial precedents by integrating Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) and historical case data in this adaptive approach. The interpretability and effectiveness of Bayesian inference in legal decision support are analyzed methodologically, emphasizing its capacity to refine probability distributions in response to evolving courtroom inputs. The findings address a key research gap by demonstrating how structured AI-driven heuristics can supplement judicial reasoning while maintaining decision accountability and transparency. The system is suggested to enhance consistency and fairness in legal judgments while preserving judicial autonomy. This study contributes to the growing intersection of AI and legal decision-making, with an emphasis placed on the role of machine learning in supporting judicial heuristics while maintaining procedural integrity.},
