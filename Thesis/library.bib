   abstract = {Bayesian networks have gained popularity as a probabilistic tool for reasoning with legal evidence. However, two common difficulties are (1) the construction and (2) the understanding of a network. In previous work, we proposed to use narrative tools and in particular scenario schemes to assist the construction and the understanding of Bayesian networks for legal cases. We proposed a construction method and a reporting format for explaining or understanding the network. The quality of a scenario, which plays an important role in the narrative approach to evidential reasoning, was not yet included in this method. In this paper, we provide a discussion of what constitutes the quality of a scenario, in terms of the narrative concepts of completeness, consistency and plausibility. We propose a probabilistic interpretation of these concepts, and show how they can be incorporated in our previously proposed method. We also illustrate with an example how these concepts concerning scenario quality can be used to explain or understand a Bayesian network.},

   abstract = {Background: Household settings are high risk for COVID-19 transmission. Understanding transmission factors associated with environmental dwelling characteristics is important in informing public health and building design recommendations. We aimed to develop a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to inform a novel analytical study examining the effect of dwelling environmental characteristics on household transmission of COVID-19. Methods: Key demographic, behavioural and environmental dwelling characteristics were identified by a multidisciplinary team. Using the DAG to visually display risk factors, and using expert knowledge of available datasets we reached a consensus on the factors included and directionality of relationships to build the final conceptual framework. Factors were displayed as nodes and relationships as pathways. Results: Of 34 potential factors, 16 were included in the DAG, with 13 causal and three biasing pathways. Three variables were not measurable using retrospective datasets. The DAG enabled us to select data sources for the pilot study period and to inform the analysis plan. Key exposure nodes were energy efficiency or dwelling age; dwelling type or number of storeys; and dwelling size. We determined direct and proxy confounders which we could adjust for, potential interactions terms we could test in model building, and co-linear variables to omit in the same model. Conclusions: The DAG helped identify key variables and datasets. It prioritised key nodes and pathways to formalise complex relationships between variables. It was pivotal in identifying unobserved variables, confounders, co-linearity and potential interactions. It has supported data selection and design of a retrospective pilot study analysis plan.},

   abstract = {Adaptive management is an iterative process of gathering new knowledge regarding a system's behavior and monitoring the ecological consequences of management actions to improve management decisions. Although the concept originated in the 1970s, it is rarely actively incorporated into ecological restoration. Bayesian networks (BNs) are emerging as efficient ecological decision-support tools well suited to adaptive management, but examples of their application in this capacity are few. We developed a BN within an adaptive-management framework that focuses on managing the effects of feral grazing and prescribed burning regimes on avian diversity within woodlands of subtropical eastern Australia. We constructed the BN with baseline data to predict bird abundance as a function of habitat structure, grazing pressure, and prescribed burning. Results of sensitivity analyses suggested that grazing pressure increased the abundance of aggressive honeyeaters, which in turn had a strong negative effect on small passerines. Management interventions to reduce pressure of feral grazing and prescribed burning were then conducted, after which we collected a second set of field data to test the response of small passerines to these measures. We used these data, which incorporated ecological changes that may have resulted from the management interventions, to validate and update the BN. The network predictions of small passerine abundance under the new habitat and management conditions were very accurate. The updated BN concluded the first iteration of adaptive management and will be used in planning the next round of management interventions. The unique belief-updating feature of BNs provides land managers with the flexibility to predict outcomes and evaluate the effectiveness of management interventions.},

BNs also have a modular architecture that facilitates iterative model development. For a model to be of value in generating and sharing knowledge or providing decision support, it must be built using good modelling practice. This paper provides guidelines to developing and evaluating Bayesian network models of environmental systems, and presents a case study habitat suitability model for juvenile Astacopsis gouldi, the giant freshwater crayfish of Tasmania. The guidelines entail clearly defining the model objectives and scope, and using a conceptual model of the system to form the structure of the BN, which should be parsimonious yet capture all key components and processes. After the states and conditional probabilities of all variables are defined, the BN should be assessed by a suite of quantitative and qualitative forms of model evaluation. All the assumptions, uncertainties, descriptions and reasoning for each node and linkage, data and information sources, and evaluation results must be clearly documented. Following these standards will enable the modelling process and the model itself to be transparent, credible and robust, within its given limitations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Since the late 1980s, Bayesian networks have also attracted researchers in forensic science and this tendency has considerably intensified throughout the last decade. This review article provides an overview of the scientific literature that describes research on Bayesian networks as a tool that can be used to study, develop and implement probabilistic procedures for evaluating the probative value of particular items of scientific evidence in forensic science. Primary attention is drawn here to evaluative issues that pertain to forensic DNA profiling evidence because this is one of the main categories of evidence whose assessment has been studied through Bayesian networks. The scope of topics is large and includes almost any aspect that relates to forensic DNA profiling. Typical examples are inference of source (or, 'criminal identification'), relatedness testing, database searching and special trace evidence evaluation (such as mixed DNA stains or stains with low quantities of DNA). The perspective of the review presented here is not exclusively restricted to DNA evidence, but also includes relevant references and discussion on both, the concept of Bayesian networks as well as its general usage in legal sciences as one among several different graphical approaches to evidence evaluation. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This paper proposes a practical methodology for combining evidence from different disciplines within the likelihood ratio framework. Evidence schemes introduced in this paper make the process of combining evidence more insightful and intuitive thereby assisting experts in their interdisciplinairy evaluation and in explaining this process to the courts. When confronted with two opposing scenarios and multiple types of evidence, the likelihood ratio approach allows experts to combine this evidence in a probabilistic manner. Parts of the prosecution and defence scenarios for which forensic science is expected to be informative are identified. For these so called core elements, activity level propositions are formulated. Afterwards evidence schemes are introduced to assist the expert in combining the evidence in a logical manner. Two types of evidence relations are identified: serial and parallel evidence. Practical guidelines are given on how to deal with both types of evidence relations when combining the evidence.},

Like all probabilities, those that underlie the nodes within a network rely on structured data and knowledge. Obviously, the more structured data we have, the better. But, in real life, the numbers of experiments that can be carried out are limited. It is thus important to know if/when our knowledge is sufficient and when one needs to perform further experiments to be in a position to report the value of the observations made. To explore the impact of the amount of data that are available for assessing results, we have constructed Bayesian Networks and explored the sensitivity of the likelihood ratios to changes to the data that underlie each node. Bayesian networks are constructed and sensitivity analyses performed using freely available R libraries (gRain and BNlearn). We demonstrate how the analyses can be used to yield information about the robustness provided by the data used to inform the conditional probability table, and also how they can be used to direct further research for maximum effect. By maximum effect, we mean to contribute with the least investment to an increased robustness. In addition, the paper investigates the consequences of the sensitivity analysis to the discussion on how the evidence shall be reported for a given state of knowledge in terms of underpinning data.},

   abstract = {In court, it is typical for biological evidence to be reported at a level that only addresses how likely the DNA evidence is if it originated from a particular individual, or individuals. However, there are other questions that could be considered that would be of value in enabling the court, including the jury, to make better informed decisions. For example, although answers to specific questions such as: “Which type of bodily fluid has the DNA originated from?” or, “How was the DNA deposited at the scene?” would be probabilistic in nature, they can be crucial to the outcome of a case. The relationship between the DNA evidence, the source of the DNA and the activity that took place is described in a term called the “hierarchy of propositions.” Currently, such questions are usually answered by scientists subjectively with little to no logical framework to assist them. Bayesian networks have proven to be beneficial in providing logical reasoning by way of a likelihood ratio to help combine subjective, yet, experience‐based, opinions of experts with experimental data when answering questions which can be both complex and uncertain. These networks offer a framework that provides balance, transparency, and robustness in the evaluation of evidence. A current limitation of the use of Bayesian networks includes a lack of understanding of the underlying concepts from both forensic scientists and the courts and consequently a reduced recognition of the potential strengths.

However, normally their application is determined by the discretization of the continuous variables. In this paper the naïve Bayes (NB) and tree augmented naïve Bayes (TAN) models are developed. They are based on Mixtures of Truncated Exponentials (MTE) designed to deal with discrete and continuous variables in the same network simultaneously without any restriction. The aim is to characterize the habitat of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca graeca), using several continuous environmental variables, and one discrete (binary) variable representing the presence or absence of the tortoise. These models are compared with the full discrete models and the results show a better classification rate for the continuous one. Therefore, the application of continuous models instead of discrete ones avoids loss of statistical information due to the discretization. Moreover, the results of the TAN continuous model show a more spatially accurate distribution of the tortoise. The species is located in the Doñana Natural Park, and in semiarid habitats. The proposed continuous models based on MTEs are valid for the study of species predictive distribution modelling. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, when faced with a large complex domain, the task of modeling using Bayesian networks begins to resemble the task of pro­ gramming using logical circuits.

We use a Bayesian net­ work fragment to describe the probabilistic relations be­ tween the attributes of an object. These attributes can themsel ves be objects, providing a natural framework for encoding part-of hierarchies. Classes are used to pro­ vide a reusable probabilistic model which can be applied to multiple similar objects. Classes also support inher­ itance of model fragments from a class to a subclass, allowing the common aspects of related classes to be defined only once. Our language has clear declarative semantics: an OOBN can be interpreted as a stochas­ tic functional program, so that it uniquely specifies a probabilistic model. We provide an inference algorithm for OOBNs, and show that much of the structural infor­ mation encoded by an OOBN-particularly the encap­ sulation of variables within an object and the reuse of model fragments in different contexts-can also be used to speed up the inference process.},

The only topological restriction imposed on the network is that, it must not contain any directed loops. The approach is illustrated step by step by solving a. genetic breeding problem. A graph representation of the domain model is interactively created by using instances of the basic network components-nodes and arcs-as building blocks.

In this work, we expand on the previously published OOBN and formalise a number of class networks that can be used together in a logical way to consider DNA movement through complex chains of transfer events. Specifically, we develop an OOBN that considers the two-way transfer of DNA that occurs when two items contact, and allows for the sampling of intermediary items involved in the chain of transfers. The aim is to show that adopting an approach involving basic building blocks, we offer the possibility to tackle complex and various cases for which the OOBN will be obtained by combining their elementary blocks. We conclude with a demonstration of applying the OOBN being applied to a chain of transfers in a case scenario.},

   abstract = {While advancing rapidly, Artificial Intelligence still falls short of human intelligence in several key aspects due to inherent limitations in current AI technologies and our understanding of cognition. Humans have an innate ability to understand context, nuances, and subtle cues in communication, which allows us to comprehend jokes, sarcasm, and metaphors. Machines struggle to interpret such contextual information accurately. Humans possess a vast repository of common-sense knowledge that helps us make logical inferences and predictions about the world. Machines lack this innate understanding and often struggle with making sense of situations that humans find trivial. In this article, we review the prospective Machine Intelligence candidates, a review from Prof. Yann LeCun, and other work that can help close this gap between human and machine intelligence. Specifically, we talk about what's lacking with the current AI techniques such as supervised learning, reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning, etc. Then we show how Hierarchical planning-based approaches can help us close that gap and deep-dive into energy-based, latent-variable methods and Joint embedding predictive architecture methods.},

We present the results of a collaborative exercise on reporting forensic genetics findings given activity level propositions. This exercise outlined differences in the methodology that was applied by the participating laboratories, as well as limitations to the use of published data on DNA TPPR. We demonstrate how publication of experimental results in scientific journals can be further improved to allow for an adequate use of these data. Steps that can be taken to share and use these data for research and casework purposes are outlined, and the prospects for future sharing of data through publicly accessible databases are discussed. This paper also explores potential avenues to proceed with implementation and is intended to fuel the discussion on sharing data pertaining to DNA TPPR issues. It is further suggested that international standardization and harmonization on these topics will benefit the forensic DNA community as it has been achieved in the past with the harmonization of STR typing systems.},

   abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

   abstract = {Questions relating to how DNA from an individual got to where it was recovered from and the activities associated with its pickup, retention and deposition are increasingly relevant to criminal investigations and judicial considerations. To address activity level propositions, investigators are typically required to assess the likelihood that DNA was transferred indirectly and not deposited through direct contact with an item or surface. By constructing a series of Bayesian networks, we demonstrate their use in assessing activity level propositions derived from a recent legal case involving the alleged secondary transfer of DNA to a surface following a handshaking event. In the absence of data required to perform the assessment, a set of handshaking simulations were performed to obtain probabilities on the persistence of non-self DNA on the hands following a 40 min, 5 h or 8 h delay between the handshake and contact with the final surface (an axe handle). Variables such as time elapsed, and the activities performed and objects contacted between the handshake and contact with the axe handle, were also considered when assessing the DNA results. DNA from a known contributor was transferred to the right hand of an opposing hand-shaker (as a depositor), and could be subsequently transferred to, and detected on, a surface contacted by the depositor 40 min to 5 h post-handshake. No non-self DNA from the known contributor was detected in deposits made 8 h post-handshake. DNA from the depositor was generally detected as the major or only contributor in the profiles generated. Contributions from the known contributor were minor, decreasing in presence and in the strength of support for inclusion as the time between the handshake and transfer event increased. The construction of a series of Bayesian networks based on the case circumstances provided empirical estimations of the likelihood of direct or indirect deposition. The analyses and conclusions presented demonstrate both the complexity of activity level assessments concerning DNA evidence, and the power of Bayesian networks to visualise and explore the issues of interest for a given case.},

The latter however will frequently entail expressing a subjective probability i.e. simply making a best guess from experience. There is, to the present date, an extensive and complex body of literature on primary, secondary, tertiary and even higher order DNA transfer, its possibility, plausibility, dependency on an array of variables and factors and vast numbers of permutations thereof. However, from our point of view there is a lack of systematic data on DNA transfer with existing research widely varying in quality and relevance. Our aim was, starting from a comprehensive survey of the status quo and appreciating its increasing importance, to in the first part of our review raise consciousness towards the underestimated and insufficiently accounted for complexity of DNA transfer and thus appendant research of forensic scientists serving as expert witnesses in court but also acting in the role of a journal referee to point them to areas of criticism when reviewing a manuscript on DNA transfer. In the second part, we present propositions how to systematize and integrate future research efforts concerning DNA transfer. Also, we present a searchable database providing an extensive overview of the current state of knowledge on DNA transfer, intended to facilitate the identification of relevant studies adding knowledge to a specific question and thus help forensic experts to base their opinion on a broader, more complete and more reproducible selection of studies.},

   abstract = {Technical developments have made it possible to analyze very low amounts of DNA. This has many advantages, but the drawback of this technological progress is that interpretation of the results becomes increasingly complex: the number of mixed DNA profiles increased relatively to single source DNA profiles and stochastic effects in the DNA profile, such as drop-in and drop-out, are more frequently observed. Moreover, the relevance of low template DNA material regarding the activities alleged is not as straightforward as it was a few years ago, when for example large quantities of blood were recovered. The possibility of secondary and tertiary transfer is now becoming an issue. The purpose of this research is twofold: first, to study the transfer of DNA from the handler and secondly, to observe if handlers would transfer DNA from persons closely connected to them. We chose to mimic cases where the offender would attack a person with a knife. As a first approach, we envisaged that the defense would not give an alternative explanation for the origin of the DNA. In our transfer experiments (4 donors, 16 experiments each, 64 traces), 3% of the traces were single DNA profiles. Most of the time, the DNA profile of the person handling the knife was present as the major profile: in 83% of the traces the major contributor profile corresponded to the stabber's DNA profile (in single stains and mixtures). Mixture with no clear major/minor fraction (12%) were observed. 5% of the traces were considered of insufficient quality (more than 3 contributors, presence of a few minor peaks). In that case, we considered that the stabber's DNA was absent. In our experiments, no traces allowed excluding the stabber, however it must be noted that precautions were taken to minimize background DNA as knives were cleaned before the experiments. DNA profiles of the stabber's colleagues were not observed. We hope that this study will allow for a better understanding of the transfer mechanism and of how to assess and describe results given activity level propositions. In this preliminary research, we have focused on the transfer of DNA on the hand of the person. Besides, more research is needed to assign the probability of the results given an alternative activity proposed by the defense, for instance when the source of the DNA is not contested, but that the activities are.},

Whereas the focus has previously been DNA transfer of target sources, the effects of background DNA on transfer and detection of DNA after multiple contact situations have been much less investigated. This study measured the transfer and detection rates of a specific DNA source in the presence of background DNA sources. The presence of background DNA influenced the transfer of DNA differently depending on the combination of biological material and surface type. The detection of a profile from the target DNA decreased after multiple contact situations, due to the reduced total and relative quantity of target DNA, and the increasing complexity of the mixture. The results of this study contribute to a greater understanding of the effects of background DNA sources on DNA transfer and detection.},

   abstract = {Bayesian logistic regression is used to model the probability of DNA recovery following direct and secondary transfer and persistence over a 24 h period between deposition and sample collection. Sub-source level likelihood ratios provided the raw data for activity-level analysis. Probabilities of secondary transfer are typically low, and there are challenges with small data-sets with low numbers of positive observations. However, the persistence of DNA over time can be modelled by a single logistic regression for both direct and secondary transfer, except that the time since deposition must be compensated by an offset value for the latter. This simplifies the analysis. Probabilities are used to inform an activity-level Bayesian Network that takes account of alternative propositions e.g. time of assault and time of social activities. The model is extended in order to take account of multiple contacts between person of interest and ’victim’. Variables taken into account include probabilities of direct and secondary transfer, along with background DNA from unknown individuals. The logistic regression analysis is Bayesian — for each analysis, 4000 separate simulations were carried out. Quantile assignments enable calculation of a plausible range of probabilities and sensitivity analysis is used to describe the corresponding variation of LRs that occur when modelled by the Bayesian network. It is noted that there is need for consistent experimental design, and analysis, to facilitate inter-laboratory comparisons. Appropriate recommendations are made. The open-source program written in R-code ALTRaP (Activity Level, Transfer, Recovery and Persistence) enables analysis of complex multiple transfer propositions that are commonplace in cases-work e.g. between those who cohabit. A number of case examples are provided. ALTRaP can be used to replicate the results and can easily be modified to incorporate different sets of data and variables.},

   abstract = {During the evaluation of forensic DNA evidence in court proceedings, the emphasis previously placed on the source of the DNA is progressively shifting to the consideration of the activities resulting in its deposition. While direct contact and deposition may be a likely explanation, alternative scenarios involving DNA transfer through a secondary person or medium are important to consider. Here we assessed whether non-self DNA, indirectly transferred via a handshake, could be detected on surfaces contacted by the opposing hand-shaker after 15 min, and considered the variables affecting its persistence in subsequent contacts. In general, the depositor of the handprint was the major contributor to DNA profiles collected from handprints placed on glass plates. Minor contributions from the opposing hand-shaker (as a known contributor) were detected at a lower rate, decreasing as the number of contacted items increased post-handshake. Delays in deposition also affected the detection of the opposing hand-shaker, with a 15 min delay between handshaking and contact resulting in the reduced presence, and corresponding LRs, of the known contributor. The handprint depositor was excluded from their own handprint on several occasions, including instances where the opposing hand-shaker was not excluded from the same profile. Several factors appeared to strongly influence the detection of both the depositor and contributing individual involved in the handshake. The relative shedding ability of the pair had the largest effect, where good shedders (whether depositor or contributor) could swamp poor to moderate shedders, while the pairing of two moderate or two poor shedders could result in the detection of both individuals. When the deposition of a handprint was delayed, the activities performed by the individual had a substantial effect on the resultant detection of the contributing profile – multiple contacts with the same items increased the likelihood that the known contributor's DNA would be retained and subsequently detected, through the parking and re-transfer of DNA on used items.},

In an effort to acquire information on the transfer and recovery of DNA traces from clothing items worn during scenarios commonly encountered in casework, upper garments were worn during a normal working day before individuals were paired to embrace one another (‘contact’), go on an outing together (‘close proximity’), or individually asked to spend a day in another person's environment (‘physical absence’). Each prescribed activity was repeated by sixteen individuals across four countries, and was the last activity performed before the garment was removed. Samples were collected from several areas of the upper garments and processed from DNA extraction through to profiling within the laboratory of the country in which the individual resided. Activities relating to the garment prior to and during wearing, including the prescribed activity, were recorded by the participant and considered during the interpretation of results. In addition to obtaining reference profiles from the wearer and their activity partner, DNA profiles from the wearers’ close associates identified in the questionnaire were obtained to assess the impact of background DNA transferred prior to the prescribed activity. The wearer was typically, but not always, observed as the major contributor to the profiles obtained. DNA from the activity partner was observed on several areas of the garment following the embrace and after temporarily occupying another person's space. Particular areas of the garment were more prone to acquiring the hugging partner or office owner's DNA than others, and whether they were observed as the major or minor component was activity dependent. For each of the pairs, no DNA from the activity partner was acquired by the garments during the outing, even though both participants were in close proximity. This study provides empirical data on the transfer, persistence, prevalence and recovery of DNA from clothing items, and enables a better understanding of the mechanisms which lead to the transfer and detectability of DNA traces in different scenarios.},

Duct tape is an evidence type in which the evaluation of physical fits is often conducted and is regarded as conclusive evidence of an association between the items. The examination and conclusion of a physical fit between edges relies heavily on examiner discretion to identify distinctive features across the edges since there are no statistical approaches or objective methodologies for the comparison. This study developed an automated image processing and comparison method to quantify tape end matches using cross-correlation scores and an empirical approach to the assessment. Characterization of 150 hand torn duct tape end pair physical fits were also conducted where matching and non-matching sample distributions were created. This study also evaluated partial duct tape edges and the influence this has on a comparison. Given the strength associated with a physical fit and the presence of stretching or deformation along the fractured edge, an understanding of the value these samples have is paramount. Furthermore, random match probabilities were calculated based on the correlation scores from the inter-comparisons to model the weight of evidence or strength of association between the edges. Finally, the study demonstrated that not every true match holds the same association strength through score distributions, but the approach is able to distinguish matching and non-matching samples at edge widths greater than 27 %.},

   abstract = {The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as "What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose a Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be indexed. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages: first to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na\"ive RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is forthcoming at https://aka.ms/graphrag.},

We used Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex progressive disease, as a model because the well-established evidence provides a "gold-standard" causal graph for evaluation. We evaluated two cSD methods, fast causal inference (fci) and fast Greedy equivalence Search (fGeS) in their ability to discover this structure from data collected by the Alzheimer's Disease neuroimaging initiative (ADni). We used structural equation models (which is not designed for cSD) as control. We applied these methods under three scenarios defined by increasing amounts of background knowledge provided to the methods. the methods were evaluated by comparing the resulting causal relationships with the "gold standard" graph that was constructed from literature. Dedicated cSD methods managed to discover graphs that nearly coincided with the gold standard. for best results, cSD algorithms should be used with longitudinal data providing as much prior knowledge as possible.},

   abstract = {Bayesian networks (BNs) are a kind of graphical model that formally combines elements of graph and probability theory. BNs are a mathematically and statistically rigorous technique allowing their user to define a pictorial representation of assumed dependencies and influences among a set of variables deemed to be relevant for a particular inferential problem. The formalism allows one to process newly acquired evidence according to the rules of probability calculus. Applications of BNs have been reported in various forensic disciplines. However, there seems to be some reluctance to consider BNs as a more general framework for representing and evaluating sources of uncertainties associated with scientific evidence. Notably, BNs are widely thought of as an essentially numerical method, requiring "exact" numbers with a high "accuracy". The present paper aims to draw the reader's attention to the point that the availability of hard numerical data is not a necessary requirement for using BNs in forensic science. An abstraction of quantitative BNs, known as qualitative probabilistic networks (QPNs), and sensitivity analyses are presented and their potential applications discussed. As a main difference to their quantitative counterpart, QPNs contain qualitative probabilistic relationships instead of numerical relations. Sensitivity analyses consist of varying the probabilities assigned to one or more variables and evaluating the effect on one or more other variables of interest. Both QPNs and sensitivity analyses appear to be useful concepts that permit one to work in contexts with acute lack of numerical data and where reasoning consistent with the laws of probability should nevertheless be performed. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Paper I of this series of papers intends to contribute to the discussion of Bayesian networks as a framework that is helpful for both illustrating and implementing statistical procedures that are commonly employed for the study of uncertainties (e.g. the estimation of unknown quantities). While the respective statistical procedures are widely described in literature, the primary aim of this paper is to offer an essentially non-technical introduction on how interested readers may use these analytical approaches - with the help of Bayesian networks - for processing their own forensic science data. Attention is mainly drawn to the structure and underlying rationale of a series of basic and context-independent network fragments that users may incorporate as building blocs while constructing larger inference models. As an example of how this may be done, the proposed concepts will be used in a second paper (Part II) for specifying graphical probability networks whose purpose is to assist forensic scientists in the evaluation of scientific evidence encountered in the context of forensic document examination (i.e. results of the analysis of black toners present on printed or copied documents). © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   abstract = {Understanding the variables impacting DNA transfer, persistence, prevalence and recovery (DNA-TPPR) has become increasingly relevant in investigations of criminal activities to provide opinion on how the DNA of a person of interest became present within the sample collected. This review considers our current knowledge regarding DNA-TPPR to assist casework investigations of criminal activities. There is a growing amount of information available on DNA-TPPR to inform the relative probabilities of the evidence given alternative scenarios relating to the presence or absence of DNA from a specific person in a collected sample of interest. This information should be used where relevant. However, far more research is still required to better understand the variables impacting DNA-TPPR and to generate more accurate probability estimates of generating particular types of profiles in more casework relevant situations. This review explores means of achieving this. It also notes the need for all those interacting with an item of interest to have an awareness of DNA transfer possibilities post criminal activity, to limit the risk of contamination or loss of DNA. Appropriately trained forensic practitioners are best placed to provide opinion and guidance on the interpretation of profiles at the activity level. However, those requested to provide expert opinion on DNA-related activity level issues are often insufficiently trained to do so. We advocate recognition of DNA activity associated expertise to be distinct from expertise associated with the identification of individuals. This is to be supported by dedicated training, competency testing, authorisation, and regular fit for purpose proficiency testing. The possibilities for experts to report on activity-related issues will increase as our knowledge increases through further research, access to relevant data is enhanced, and tools to assist interpretations are better exploited. Improvement opportunities will be achieved sooner, if more laboratories and agencies accept the need to invest in these aspects as well as the training of practitioners.},

Although it is a topic with a long history, it has never been considered to be such a critically important topic for the field, as today. With the increasing sensitivity of analysis techniques, and advances in data interpretation using probabilistic models (‘probabilistic genotyping’), there is an increasing demand on forensic biologists to share specialised knowledge to help recipients of expert information address mode and timing of transfer and persistence of traces in court. Scientists thereby have a critical role in the assessment of their findings in the context of the case. This helps the judiciary with activity level inferences in a balanced, robust and transparent way, when based on (1) proper case assessment and interpretation respecting the hierarchy of propositions (supported by, for example, the use of Bayesian networks as graphical models), (2) use of appropriate data to inform probabilities, and (3) reporting guidelines by international bodies. This critical review of current literature shows that with certain prerequisites for training and quality assurance, there is a solid foundation for evidence interpretation when propositions of interest are at the ‘activity level’.},

The issues surrounding questions of the kind “whose DNA is this?” have been the subject of considerable controversy but now it is clear that the emphasis is shifting to questions of the kind “how did this DNA get here?” Such issues are discussed in this paper and new insights are provided by two particular recent developments. First, the notion of the “hierarchy of propositions” that has arisen from a project called Case Assessment and Interpretation (CAI) that has been running in the British Forensic Science Service (FSS). Second, a technique for drawing inferences in the face of many interacting considerations, known as “Bayesian networks”— or “Bayes' nets“ for short—that has been the subject of an earlier paper in this journal (1). The discussion is carried out by means of case studies, based on actual cases. It is clear that, whereas the inference in relation to the source of the DNA in a crime sample might be overwhelmingly strong, the inference in relation to the propositions that a jury must consider relating to the identity of the actual offender may be much more tentative.},

Accordingly, the argument often made in criminal courts is not who the DNA belongs to but rather how it was deposited.

The purpose of this study was to gain an overview of the opinions about activity level reporting (ALR) held by forensic biologists in the United States. A seventeen-question survey was distributed to members of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors and U.S. members of the International Society for Forensic Genetics. The survey included multiple-choice and open-response questions and received 54 responses. The majority of responses expressed moderate support of ALR. Participants mentioned six major concerns to be addressed prior to implementing ALR in the United States: (1) effect of number of variables involved; (2) need of education for practitioners/legal system; (3) inadequate number of activity studies with realistic scenarios; (4) difficulty of achieving admissibility in court; (5) need for standardized approaches/guidelines; and (6) requisite shift in perspective as to the validity of ALR. Overall, this small segment of U.S. forensic DNA practitioners appear to be willing to implement ALR once these concerns are fully addressed and resolved. As a follow-up, it would be worthwhile exploring these and other questions with a larger group and also other disciplines.},

   abstract = {<h2>Abstract</h2><p>The sensitivity of DNA analysis has progressed to the point that trace levels of DNA, originating from only a few cells, can generate informative profiles. This means that virtually any item or surface can be sampled with a reasonable chance of obtaining a DNA profile. As the presence of DNA does not suggest how it was deposited, questions are often raised as to how the DNA came to be at a particular location and the activity that led to its deposition. Therefore, understanding different modes of DNA deposition, reflective of realistic forensic casework situations, is critical for proper evaluation of DNA results in court. This study aimed to follow the movements of DNA to and from individuals and common household surfaces in a residential premises, while socially interacting. This took place over an hour and involved four participants, with known shedder status, designated as visitors (a male and a female) and hosts (a male and a female), who engaged in the activity of playing a board game while being served food. During the study, the participants were instructed to use the toilet on a single occasion to assess the transfer of DNA to new and unused underwear that was provided. All contacts made by the participants in the dining room and kitchen were video recorded to follow the movements of DNA. Samples were collected based on the history of contact, which included hands, fingernails and penile swabs. Direct contacts resulted in detectable transfer (LR > 1) in 87 % (87/100) of the non-intimate samples and clothing. For surfaces touched by multiple participants, DNA from the person who made the last contact was not always detectable. The duration and number of contacts did not significantly affect the detection of the person contacting the item. On the other hand, presence of background DNA and participant's shedder status appear to play an important role. Further, unknown contributors were detected in the majority of samples. Finally, indirect transfer was observed on a number of occasions including co-habiting partners of guests who were not present at the study location. The results of this study may assist with decision making for exhibit selection or targeting areas for sampling within the home environment. Our findings can also be used in conjunction with previous literature to develop activity-level evaluations in such situations where the source of the DNA is conceded, but the mode of deposition is disputed.</p>},

   abstract = {For many criminal cases, the source of who deposited the DNA is not what the prosecutor and the defense are trying to dispute. In court, the question may be how the DNA was deposited at the crime scene rather than who the DNA came from. Although laboratories in many countries have begun to evaluate DNA evidence given formal activity-level propositions (ALPs), it is unknown how much other forensic practitioners know and what they think about activity-level evaluative reporting (ALR). To collect this information, a survey with 21 questions was submitted to international forensic science organizations across Europe, Australia, South America, Canada, Asia, and Africa. The survey combined open-ended and multiple-choice questions and received 162 responses. Responses revealed a wide range of knowledge on the topic. Overall, most respondents were somewhat knowledgeable about ALR, ALP, and current practices in court and expressed their support of the concept. A majority of participants identified gaps and obstacles regarding ALR they would like to see addressed. Examples include (1) need for more education/training at all stakeholder levels, (2) need for more DNA evidence-related data under realistic case scenarios, (3) need to internally implement and validate a formalized and objective approach for reporting, and (4) in some countries the need to achieve court admissibility. This global survey gathered the current concerns of forensic DNA practitioners and outlined several operational concerns. The information can be used to advance the implementation of ALR in laboratories and court testimony worldwide.},

Twenty years after its foundation, ENFSI is now a pre-eminent voice on forensic science in Europe with privileged relationships with institutions such as the European Commission (with the privileged status of an EU-monopolist), Europol, CEPOL, Eurojust and Interpol. A diversity of approaches in the assessment of the scientific findings Compare these two statements taken from practice: (1) The matching glass fragments recovered on the garment of Mr S. are consistent with coming from the broken window. (2) The matching glass fragments recovered on the garment of Mr S. are more likely to be found if Mr S. broke the window rather than if he had nothing to do with the incident. The first statement only considers the results given one version of the events and thus is unbalanced and potentially misleading. The second statement offers a relative assessment of the findings given two stated scenarios. Such diversity is easy to observe among the members of the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI). The ENFSI working groups deal with areas of practice such as firearms, drugs, biological traces (DNA), marks (fingerprints, footwear), documents, microtraces (glass, fibres, hair, soils, plants), explosives, audio (voice), video (face, gait) and digital information, crime scene investigation, road accidents and fire investigation. These are the areas targeted by the ENFSI Guideline. This diversity has adverse consequences. First, the lack of declared common criteria-and adherence thereto-for assessing and reporting scientific findings offers no guarantee that the scientific findings are assessed consistently and within a logical framework. For example, the same findings could lead practitioners to express conclusions that convey drastically different messages: from an undefined and prone to misinterpretation "match and consistent with" to a transparent disclosure of the weight to be attached to the findings. Ambiguous wording of scientific conclusions has been recognised as a factor leading to miscarriages of justice.},

   abstract = {Daubert skews the contribution of forensic science because it only took into account its Galilean dimension (construction of general predictive models). However, forensic science should better be classified in the historical sciences (clinical approach to reconstruct a past event of presence or activity). We therefore need a complementary approach that integrates the necessarily “clinical” part in the resolution of forensic issues. Such an evolution involves semiotics. While recognizing that the Bayesian way of thinking is the only prescriptive available model for interpretation fitting well in the Galilean paradigm, the complexity of the reconstruction of a past‐uncontrolled singular case and the robustness of available relevant data to it, invites consideration of its implementation in a semiotic line of arguments. Indeed, Bayes makes it possible to remain in a single harmonized model integrating both the clinical and Galilean dimensions, but rapidly the complexity of the modeling and its mathematization come up against more qualitative natural and legal reasoning. Two different systems of reasoning at stake are inevitably creating a “bug” that could explain the current forensic crisis and miscarriages of justice. This anomaly is reflected in the issue of transparency (misunderstandings by and between interlocutors on the nature of the expertise, if not science). Peirce offers a path to address the tension between complementary reasoning systems.

   abstract = {In criminal trials, evidence often involves a degree of uncertainty and decision-making includes moving from the initial presumption of innocence to inference about guilt based on that evidence. The jurors’ ability to combine evidence and make accurate intuitive probabilistic judgments underpins this process. Previous research has shown that errors in probabilistic reasoning can be explained by a misalignment of the evidence presented with the intuitive causal models that people construct. This has been explored in abstract and context-free situations. However, less is known about how people interpret evidence in context-rich situations such as legal cases. The present study examined participants’ intuitive probabilistic reasoning in legal contexts and assessed how people’s causal models underlie the process of belief updating in the light of new evidence. The study assessed whether participants update beliefs in line with Bayesian norms and if errors in belief updating can be explained by the causal structures underpinning the evidence integration process. The study was based on a recent case in England where a couple was accused of intentionally harming their baby but was eventually exonerated because the child’s symptoms were found to be caused by a rare blood disorder. Participants were presented with a range of evidence, one piece at a time, including physical evidence and reports from experts. Participants made probability judgments about the abuse and disorder as causes of the child’s symptoms. Subjective probability judgments were compared against Bayesian norms. The causal models constructed by participants were also elicited. Results showed that overall participants revised their beliefs appropriately in the right direction based on evidence. However, this revision was done without exact Bayesian computation and errors were observed in estimating the weight of evidence. Errors in probabilistic judgments were partly accounted for, by differences in the causal models representing the evidence. Our findings suggest that understanding causal models that guide people’s judgments may help shed light on errors made in evidence integration and potentially identify ways to address accuracy in judgment.},
